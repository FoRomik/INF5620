INF5620
=======

Course material for the course INF5620 Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations.

**Note 1: All material in this repo is considered old (from 2013).
New versions of the material are published in a new repo
[num-methods-for-PDEs](http://hplgit.github.io/num-methods-for-PDEs/doc/web/index.html). Please use that repo and not the present one.**

Note 2: Never do a pull request with a fork of this repository, because the
files in this repository are generated from a source stored elsewhere.
Typos and errors must be corrected in the source, and new files in
the INF5620 will then be automatically generated.
