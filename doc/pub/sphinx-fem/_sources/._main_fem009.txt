Finite elements in 2D and 3D
============================

Finite element approximation is particularly powerful in 2D and 3D because
the method can handle a geometrically complex domain :math:`\Omega` with ease.
The principal idea is, as in 1D, to divide the domain into cells
and use polynomials for approximating a function over a cell.
Two popular cell shapes are triangles and the quadrilaterals.
Figures :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:rectP1`, :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:circP1`,
and :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:rectQ1` provide examples. P1 elements
means linear functions (:math:`a_0 + a_1x + a_2y`) over triangles, while Q1 elements
have bilinear functions (:math:`a_0 + a_1x + a_2y + a_3xy`) over rectangular cells.
Higher-order elements can easily be defined.

Basis functions over triangles in the physical domain
-----------------------------------------------------

Cells with triangular shape will be in main focus here.  With the P1
triangular element, :math:`u` is a linear function over each cell, as
depicted in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:femfunc`, with
discontinuous derivatives at the cell boundaries.

   :width: 400

   *Example on piecewise linear 2D functions defined on triangles*


We give the vertices of the cells global and local numbers as in 1D.
The degrees of freedom in the P1 element are the function values at
a set of nodes, which are the three vertices.
The basis function :math:`{\varphi}_i(x,y)` is then 1 at the vertex with global vertex
number :math:`i` and zero at all other vertices.
On an element, the three degrees of freedom uniquely determine
the linear basis functions in that element, as usual.
The global
:math:`{\varphi}_i(x,y)` function is then a combination of the linear functions
(planar surfaces)
over all the neighboring cells
that have vertex number :math:`i` in common. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:basphi`
tries to illustrate the shape of such a "pyramid"-like function.

   *Example on a piecewise linear 2D basis function over a patch of triangles*


Element matrices and vectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As in 1D, we split the integral over :math:`\Omega` into a sum of integrals
over cells. Also as in 1D, :math:`{\varphi}_i` overlaps :math:`{\varphi}_j`
(i.e., :math:`{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j\neq 0`) if and only if
:math:`i` and :math:`j` are vertices in the same cell. Therefore, the integral
of :math:`{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j` over an element is nonzero only when :math:`i` and :math:`j`
run over the vertex numbers in the element. These nonzero contributions
to the coefficient matrix are, as in 1D, collected in an element matrix.
The size of the element matrix becomes :math:`3\times 3` since there are
three degrees of freedom
that :math:`i` and :math:`j` run over. Again, as in 1D, we number the
local vertices in a cell, starting at 0, and add the entries in
the element matrix into the global system matrix, exactly as in 1D.
All details and code appear below.



Basis functions over triangles in the reference cell
----------------------------------------------------

As in 1D, we can define the basis functions and the degrees of freedom
in a reference cell and then use a mapping from the reference coordinate
system to the physical coordinate system.
We also have a mapping of local degrees of freedom numbers to global degrees
of freedom numbers.

.. (``dof_map``).


The reference cell in an :math:`(X,Y)` coordinate system has vertices
:math:`(0,0)`, :math:`(1,0)`, and :math:`(0,1)`, corresponding to local vertex numbers
0, 1, and 2, respectively. The P1 element has linear functions
:math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X,Y)` as basis functions, :math:`r=0,1,2`.
Since a linear function :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X,Y)` in 2D is on
the form :math:`C_{r,0} + C_{r,1}X + C_{r,2}Y`, and hence has three
parameters :math:`C_{r,0}`, :math:`C_{r,1}`, and :math:`C_{r,2}`, we need three
degrees of freedom. These are in general taken as the function values at a
set of nodes. For the P1 element the set of nodes is the three vertices.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P12D` displays the geometry of the
element and the location of the nodes.


.. _fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P12D:

.. figure:: P1_2d.png
   :width: 100

   *2D P1 element*


Requiring :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r=1` at node number :math:`r` and
:math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r=0` at the two other nodes, gives three linear equations to
determine :math:`C_{r,0}`, :math:`C_{r,1}`, and :math:`C_{r,2}`. The result is


.. math::
        
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_0(X,Y) = 1 - X - Y,
        



.. math::
          
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_1(X,Y) = X,
        



.. math::
          
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_2(X,Y) = Y
        


Higher-order approximations are obtained by increasing the polynomial order,
adding additional nodes, and letting the degrees of freedom be
function values at the nodes. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P22D`
shows the location of the six nodes in the P2 element.

   *2D P2 element*


.. 2DO: write up local basis funcs for P2


A polynomial of degree :math:`p` in :math:`X` and :math:`Y` has :math:`n_p=(p+1)(p+2)/2` terms
and hence needs :math:`n_p` nodes. The values at the nodes constitute :math:`n_p`
degrees of freedom. The location of the nodes for
:math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r` up to degree 6 is displayed in Figure
:ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P162D`.

   *2D P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6 elements*


The generalization to 3D is straightforward: the reference element is a
`tetrahedron <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron>`_
with vertices :math:`(0,0,0)`, :math:`(1,0,0)`, :math:`(0,1,0)`, and :math:`(0,0,1)`
in a :math:`X,Y,Z` reference coordinate system. The P1 element has its degrees
of freedom as four nodes, which are the four vertices, see Figure
:ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P1:123D`. The P2 element adds additional
nodes along the edges of the cell, yielding a total of 10 nodes and
degrees of freedom, see
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P2:123D`.

The interval in 1D, the triangle in 2D, the tetrahedron in 3D, and
its generalizations to higher space dimensions are known
as *simplex* cells (the geometry) or *simplex* elements (the geometry,
basis functions, degrees of freedom, etc.). The plural forms
`simplices <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex>`_ and
simplexes are
also a much used shorter terms when referring to this type of cells or elements.
The side of a simplex is called a *face*, while the tetrahedron also
has *edges*.

Affine mapping of the reference cell
------------------------------------

Let :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r^{(1)}` denote the basis functions associated
with the P1 element in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and let :math:`\boldsymbol{x}_{q(e,r)}` be
the physical coordinates of local vertex number :math:`r` in cell :math:`e`.
Furthermore,
let :math:`\boldsymbol{X}` be a point in the reference coordinate system corresponding
to the point :math:`\boldsymbol{x}` in the physical coordinate system.
The affine mapping of any :math:`\boldsymbol{X}` onto :math:`\boldsymbol{x}` is
then defined by


.. index:: affine mapping



.. _Eq:fem:approx:fe:affine:map:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:affine:map
        
        \boldsymbol{x} = \sum_{r} {\tilde{\varphi}}_r^{(1)}(\boldsymbol{X})\boldsymbol{x}_{q(e,r)},
        
        

where :math:`r` runs over the local vertex numbers in the cell.
The affine mapping essentially stretches, translates, and rotates
the triangle. Straight or planar faces of the reference cell are
therefore mapped onto
straight or planar faces in the physical coordinate system. The mapping can
be used for both P1 and higher-order elements, but note that the
mapping itself always applies the P1 basis functions.

   *Affine mapping of a P1 element*




Isoparametric mapping of the reference cell
-------------------------------------------


.. index:: isoparametric mapping

.. index::
   single: mapping of reference cells; isoparametric mapping


Instead of using the P1 basis functions in the mapping
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:affine:map`,
we may use the basis functions of the actual Pd element:


.. _Eq:fem:approx:fe:isop:map:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:isop:map
        
        \boldsymbol{x} = \sum_{r} {\tilde{\varphi}}_r(\boldsymbol{X})\boldsymbol{x}_{q(e,r)},
        
        

where :math:`r` runs over all nodes, i.e., all points associated with the
degrees of freedom. This is called an *isoparametric mapping*.
For P1 elements it is identical to the affine mapping
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:affine:map`, but for higher-order elements
the mapping of the straight or planar faces of the reference cell will
result in a *curved* face in the physical coordinate system.
For example, when we use the basis functions of the triangular P2 element
in 2D in :eq:`fem:approx:fe:isop:map`, the straight faces of the
reference triangle are mapped onto curved faces of parabolic shape in
the physical coordinate system, see Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:map:fig:2DP2`.


.. _fem:approx:fe:map:fig:2DP2:

.. figure:: ElmT6n2D_map.png
   :width: 400

   *Isoparametric mapping of a P2 element*


From :eq:`fem:approx:fe:affine:map` or
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:isop:map` it is easy to realize that the
vertices are correctly mapped. Consider a vertex with local number :math:`s`.
Then :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_s=1` at this vertex and zero at the others.
This means that only one term in the sum is nonzero and :math:`\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{x}_{q(e,s)}`,
which is the coordinate of this vertex in the global coordinate system.


Computing integrals
-------------------

Let :math:`\tilde\Omega^r` denote the reference cell and :math:`\Omega^{(e)}`
the cell in the physical coordinate system. The transformation of
the integral from the physical to the reference coordinate system reads


.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}{\varphi}_i (\boldsymbol{x}) {\varphi}_j (\boldsymbol{x}) {\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        \int_{\tilde\Omega^r} {\tilde{\varphi}}_i (\boldsymbol{X}) {\tilde{\varphi}}_j (\boldsymbol{X})
        \det J\, {\, \mathrm{d}X},
        



.. math::
          
        \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}{\varphi}_i (\boldsymbol{x}) f(\boldsymbol{x}) {\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        \int_{\tilde\Omega^r} {\tilde{\varphi}}_i (\boldsymbol{X}) f(\boldsymbol{x}(\boldsymbol{X})) \det J\, {\, \mathrm{d}X},
        

where :math:`{\, \mathrm{d}x}` means the infinitesimal area element :math:`dx dy` in 2D and
:math:`dx dy dz` in 3D, with a similar
definition of :math:`{\, \mathrm{d}X}`. The quantity :math:`\det J` is the determinant of the
Jacobian of the mapping :math:`\boldsymbol{x}(\boldsymbol{X})`. In 2D,


.. _Eq:fem:approx:fe:2D:mapping:J:detJ:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:2D:mapping:J:detJ
        
        J = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
        \frac{\partial x}{\partial X} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial Y}\\ 
        \frac{\partial y}{\partial X} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial Y}
        \end{array}\right], \quad
        \det J = \frac{\partial x}{\partial X}\frac{\partial y}{\partial Y}
        - \frac{\partial x}{\partial Y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial X}
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

With the affine mapping
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:affine:map`, :math:`\det J=2\Delta`, where :math:`\Delta` is
the area or volume of the cell in the physical coordinate system.

**Remark.**
Observe that finite elements in 2D and 3D builds on the same
*ideas* and *concepts* as in 1D, but there is simply much
more to compute because the
specific mathematical formulas in 2D and 3D are more complicated
and the book keeping with dof maps also gets more complicated.
The manual work is tedious, lengthy, and error-prone
so automation by the computer is a must.
