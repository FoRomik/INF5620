Generalization: damping, nonlinear spring, and external excitation
==================================================================

.. index:: nonlinear restoring force

.. index:: nonlinear spring

.. index:: forced vibrations

We shall now generalize the simple model problem from
the section :ref:`vib:model1` to include a possibly nonlinear damping term :math:`f(u^{\prime})`,
a possibly nonlinear spring (or restoring) force :math:`s(u)`, and
some external excitation :math:`F(t)`:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode2
        
        mu^{\prime\prime} + f(u^{\prime}) + s(u) = F(t),\quad u(0)=I,\ u^{\prime}(0)=V,\ t\in (0,T]
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

We have also included a possibly nonzero initial value of :math:`u^{\prime}(0)`.
The parameters :math:`m`, :math:`f(u^{\prime})`, :math:`s(u)`, :math:`F(t)`, :math:`I`, :math:`V`, and :math:`T` are
input data.

There are two main types of damping (friction) forces: linear :math:`f(u^{\prime})=bu`, or
quadratic :math:`f(u^{\prime})=bu^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|`. Spring systems often feature linear
damping, while air resistance usually gives rise to quadratic damping.
Spring forces are often linear: :math:`s(u)=cu`, but nonlinear versions
are also common, the most famous is the gravity force on a pendulum
that acts as a spring with :math:`s(u)\sim \sin(u)`.

.. _vib:ode2:fdm:flin:

A centered scheme for linear damping
------------------------------------

Sampling :eq:`vib:ode2` at a mesh point :math:`t_n`, replacing
:math:`u^{\prime\prime}(t_n)` by :math:`[D_tD_tu]^n`, and :math:`u^{\prime}(t_n)` by :math:`[D_{2t}u]^n` results
in the discretization

.. math::
        
        [mD_tD_t u + f(D_{2t}u) + s(u) = F]^n,
        

which written out means

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step3b:

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode2:step3b
        
        m\frac{u^{n+1}-2u^n + u^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
        + f(\frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n-1}}{2\Delta t}) + s(u^n) = F^n,
        
        

where :math:`F^n` as usual means :math:`F(t)` evaluated at :math:`t=t_n`.
Solving :eq:`vib:ode2:step3b` with respect to the unknown
:math:`u^{n+1}` gives a problem: the :math:`u^{n+1}` inside the :math:`f` function
makes the equation *nonlinear* unless :math:`f(u^{\prime})` is a linear function,
:math:`f(u^{\prime})=bu^{\prime}`. For now we shall assume that :math:`f` is linear in :math:`u^{\prime}`.
Then

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step3b2:

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode2:step3b2
        
        m\frac{u^{n+1}-2u^n + u^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
        + b\frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n-1}}{2\Delta t} + s(u^n) = F^n,
        
        

which gives an explicit formula for :math:`u` at each
new time level:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step4:

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode2:step4
        
        u^{n+1} = (2mu^n + (\frac{b}{2}\Delta t - m)u^{n-1} +
        \Delta t^2(F^n - s(u^n)))(m + \frac{b}{2}\Delta t)^{-1}
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

For the first time step we need to discretize :math:`u^{\prime}(0)=V`
as :math:`[D_{2t}u = V]^0` and combine
with :eq:`vib:ode2:step4` for :math:`n=0`. The discretized initial condition
leads to

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:ic:du:

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode2:ic:du
        
        u^{-1} = u^{1} - 2\Delta t V,
        
        

which inserted in :eq:`vib:ode2:step4` for :math:`n=0` gives an equation
that can be solved for
:math:`u^1`:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step4b:

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode2:step4b
        
        u^1 = u^0 + \Delta t\, V
        + \frac{\Delta t^2}{2m}(-bV - s(u^0) + F^0)
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

.. _vib:ode2:fdm:fquad:

A centered scheme for quadratic damping
---------------------------------------

When :math:`f(u^{\prime})=bu^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|`, we get a quadratic equation for :math:`u^{n+1}`
in :eq:`vib:ode2:step3b`. This equation can straightforwardly
be solved, but we can also avoid the nonlinearity by
performing an approximation that is within
other numerical errors that we have already committed by replacing
derivatives with finite differences.

.. index:: geometric mean

.. index::
   single: averaging; geometric

The idea is to reconsider :eq:`vib:ode2` and only replace
:math:`u^{\prime\prime}` by :math:`D_tD_tu`, giving

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:quad:idea1:

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode2:quad:idea1
        
        [mD_tD_t u + bu^{\prime}|u^{\prime}| + s(u) = F]^n,
        
        

Here, :math:`u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|` is to be computed at time :math:`t_n`. We can introduce
a *geometric mean*, defined by

.. math::
         (w^2)^n \approx w^{n-\frac{1}{2}}w^{n+\frac{1}{2}},

for some quantity :math:`w` depending on time. The error in the geometric mean
approximation is :math:`{\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)}`, the same as in the
approximation :math:`u^{\prime\prime}\approx D_tD_tu`. With :math:`w=u^{\prime}` it follows
that

.. math::
         [u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|]^n \approx u^{\prime}(t_n+\frac{1}{2})|u^{\prime}(t_n-\frac{1}{2})|{\thinspace .}

The next step is to approximate
:math:`u^{\prime}` at :math:`t_{n\pm 1/2}`, but here a centered difference can be used:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:quad:idea2:

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode2:quad:idea2
        
        u^{\prime}(t_{n+1/2})\approx [D_t u]^{n+\frac{1}{2}},\quad u^{\prime}(t_{n-1/2})\approx [D_t u]^{n-\frac{1}{2}}
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

We then get

.. math::
        
        [u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|]^n
        \approx [D_tu]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}|[D_tu]^{n-\frac{1}{2}}| = \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t}
        \frac{|u^n-u^{n-1}|}{\Delta t}
        {\thinspace .}
        

The counterpart to :eq:`vib:ode2:step3b` is then

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step3b:quad:

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode2:step3b:quad
        
        m\frac{u^{n+1}-2u^n + u^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
        + b\frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t}\frac{|u^n-u^{n-1}|}{\Delta t}
        + s(u^n) = F^n,
        
        

which is linear in :math:`u^{n+1}`. Therefore, we can easily solve
with respect to :math:`u^{n+1}` and achieve
the explicit updating formula

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} =  \left( m + b|u^n-u^{n-1}|\right)^{-1}\times \nonumber
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step4:quad:

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode2:step4:quad
          
         \qquad \left(2m u^n - mu^{n-1} + bu^n|u^n-u^{n-1}| + \Delta t^2 (F^n - s(u^n))
        \right)
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

.. Make exercise to solve complicated u^1 equation with Bisection/Newton

In the derivation of a special equation for the first
time step we run into some trouble: inserting :eq:`vib:ode2:ic:du`
in :eq:`vib:ode2:step4:quad` for :math:`n=0` results in a complicated nonlinear
equation for :math:`u^1`. By thinking differently about the problem we can
easily get away with the nonlinearity again. We have for :math:`n=0` that
:math:`b[u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|]^0 = bV|V|`. Using this value in :eq:`vib:ode2:quad:idea1`
gives

.. math::
        
        [mD_tD_t u + bV|V| + s(u) = F]^0
        {\thinspace .}
        

Writing this equation out and using :eq:`vib:ode2:ic:du` results in the
special equation for the first time step:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:step4b:quad:

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode2:step4b:quad
        
        u^1 = u^0 + \Delta t V + \frac{\Delta t^2}{2m}\left(-bV|V| - s(u^0) + F^0\right)
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

A forward-backward discretization of the quadratic damping term
---------------------------------------------------------------

The previous section first proposed to discretize
the quadratic damping term :math:`|u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}` using centered differences:
:math:`[|D_{2t}|D_{2t}u]^n`. As this gives rise to a nonlinearity in
:math:`u^{n+1}`, it was instead proposed to use a geometric mean combined
with centered differences.
But there are other alternatives. To get rid of the nonlinearity
in :math:`[|D_{2t}|D_{2t}u]^n`, one can think differently:
apply a backward difference to :math:`|u^{\prime}|`, such that the term involves known
values, and apply a forward difference to :math:`u^{\prime}` to make the term linear
in the unknown :math:`u^{n+1}`. With mathematics,

.. math::
         [\beta |u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}]^n \approx \beta |[D_t^-u]^n|[D_t^+ u]^n =
        \beta\left\vert\frac{u^-u^{n-1}}{\Delta t}\right\vert
        \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t}{\thinspace .}

The forward and backward differences have both an error proportional
to :math:`\Delta t` so one may think the discretization above leads to
a first-order scheme.
However, by looking at the formulas, we realize that the forward-backward
differences result in exactly the same scheme as when we
used a geometric mean and centered differences. Therefore, the forward-backward
differences act in a symmetric way and actually produce a second-order
accurate discretization of the quadratic damping term.

.. _vib:ode2:solver:

Implementation  (3)
-------------------

The algorithm arising from the methods in the sections :ref:`vib:ode2:fdm:flin`
and :ref:`vib:ode2:fdm:fquad` is very similar to the undamped case in
the section :ref:`vib:ode1:fdm`. The difference is
basically a question of different formulas for :math:`u^1` and
:math:`u^{n+1}`. This is actually quite remarkable. The equation
:eq:`vib:ode2` is normally impossible to solve by pen and paper, but
possible for some special choices of :math:`F`, :math:`s`, and :math:`f`. On the
contrary, the complexity of the
nonlinear generalized model :eq:`vib:ode2` versus the
simple undamped model is not a big deal when we solve the
problem numerically!

The computational algorithm takes the form

 1. :math:`u^0=I`

 2. compute :math:`u^1` from :eq:`vib:ode2:step4b` if linear
    damping or :eq:`vib:ode2:step4b:quad` if quadratic damping

 3. for :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N_t-1`:

   1. compute :math:`u^{n+1}` from :eq:`vib:ode2:step4` if linear
      damping or :eq:`vib:ode2:step4:quad` if quadratic damping

Modifying the ``solver`` function for the undamped case is fairly
easy, the big difference being many more terms and if tests on
the type of damping:

.. code-block:: python

        def solver(I, V, m, b, s, F, dt, T, damping='linear'):
            """
            Solve m*u'' + f(u') + s(u) = F(t) for t in (0,T],
            u(0)=I and u'(0)=V,
            by a central finite difference method with time step dt.
            If damping is 'linear', f(u')=b*u, while if damping is
            'quadratic', f(u')=b*u'*abs(u').
            F(t) and s(u) are Python functions.

            Nt = int(round(T/dt))
            u = zeros(Nt+1)
            t = linspace(0, Nt*dt, Nt+1)
        
            u[0] = I
            if damping == 'linear':
                u[1] = u[0] + dt*V + dt**2/(2*m)*(-b*V - s(u[0]) + F(t[0]))

            for n in range(1, Nt):
                if damping == 'linear':
                    u[n+1] = (2*m*u[n] + (b*dt/2 - m)*u[n-1] +
                              dt**2*(F(t[n]) - s(u[n])))/(m + b*dt/2)
                elif damping == 'quadratic':

                              + dt**2*(F(t[n]) - s(u[n])))/\ 
                              (m + b*abs(u[n] - u[n-1]))
            return u, t

Verification  (2)
-----------------

Constant solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For debugging and initial verification, a constant solution is often
very useful. We choose :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(t)=I`, which implies :math:`V=0`.
Inserted in the ODE, we get
:math:`F(t)=s(I)` for any choice of :math:`f`. Since the discrete derivative
of a constant vanishes (in particular, :math:`[D_{2t}I]^n=0`,
:math:`[D_tI]^n=0`, and :math:`[D_tD_t I]^n=0`), the constant solution also fulfills
the discrete equations. The constant should therefore be reproduced
to machine precision.

Linear solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we choose a linear solution: :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}} = ct + d`. The initial condition
:math:`u(0)=I` implies :math:`d=I`, and :math:`u^{\prime}(0)=V` forces :math:`c` to be :math:`V`.
Inserting :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}=Vt+I` in the ODE with linear damping results in

.. math::
         0 + bV + s(Vt+I) = F(t),

while quadratic damping requires the source term

.. math::
         0 + b|V|V + s(Vt+I) = F(t){\thinspace .}

Since the finite difference approximations used to compute :math:`u^{\prime}` all
are exact for a linear function, it turns out that the linear :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}`
is also a solution of the discrete equations.
:ref:`vib:exer:verify:gen:linear` asks you to carry out
all the details.

Quadratic solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choosing :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}} = bt^2 + Vt + I`, with :math:`b` arbitrary,
fulfills the initial conditions and
fits the ODE if :math:`F` is adjusted properly. The solution also solves
the discrete equations with linear damping. However, this quadratic
polynomial in :math:`t` does not fulfill the discrete equations in case
of quadratic damping, because the geometric mean used in the approximation
of this term introduces an error.
Doing :ref:`vib:exer:verify:gen:linear` will reveal
the details. One can fit :math:`F^n` in the discrete equations such that
the quadratic polynomial is reproduced by the numerical method (to
machine precision).

Visualization
-------------

The functions for visualizations differ significantly from
those in the undamped case in the ``vib_undamped.py`` program because
we in the present general case do not have an exact solution to
include in the plots. Moreover, we have no good estimate of
the periods of the oscillations as there will be one period
determined by the system parameters, essentially the
approximate frequency :math:`\sqrt{s'(0)/m}` for linear :math:`s` and small damping,
and one period dictated by :math:`F(t)` in case the excitation is periodic.
This is, however,
nothing that the program can depend on or make use of.
Therefore, the user has to specify :math:`T` and the window width
in case of a plot that moves with the graph and shows
the most recent parts of it in long time simulations.

The ``vib.py`` code
contains several functions for analyzing the time series signal
and for visualizing the solutions.

User interface
--------------

.. index:: ArgumentParser (Python class)

.. index:: argparse (Python module)

The ``main`` function has substantial changes from
the ``vib_undamped.py`` code since we need to
specify the new data :math:`c`, :math:`s(u)`, and :math:`F(t)`.  In addition, we must
set :math:`T` and the plot window width (instead of the number of periods we
want to simulate as in ``vib_undamped.py``). To figure out whether we
can use one plot for the whole time series or if we should follow the
most recent part of :math:`u`, we can use the ``plot_empricial_freq_and_amplitude``
function's estimate of the number of local maxima. This number is now
returned from the function and used in ``main`` to decide on the
visualization technique.

The Euler-Cromer scheme for the generalized model
-------------------------------------------------

The ideas of the Euler-Cromer method from the section :ref:`vib:model2x2:EulerCromer`
carry over to the generalized model. We write :eq:`vib:ode2`
as two equations for :math:`u` and :math:`v=u^{\prime}`. The first equation is taken as the
one with :math:`v'` on the left-hand side:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:veq:

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode2:EulerCromer:veq
        
        v' = \frac{1}{m}(F(t)-s(u)-f(v)),
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:ueq:

        u^{\prime} = v{\thinspace .}
        
        

The idea is to step :eq:`vib:ode2:EulerCromer:veq` forward using
a standard Forward Euler method, while we update :math:`u` from
:eq:`vib:ode2:EulerCromer:ueq` with a Backward Euler method,
utilizing the recent, computed :math:`v^{n+1}` value. In detail,

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:EulerCromer:dveq0:

   :label: vib:ode2:EulerCromer:dveq0
        
        \frac{v^{n+1}-v^n}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{m}(F(t_n)-s(u^n)-f(v^n)),

hence much more convenient than the centered scheme for the second-order

Problem 1: Use linear/quadratic functions for verification
----------------------------------------------------------

Consider the ODE problem

.. math::
         u^{\prime\prime} + \omega^2u=f(t), \quad u(0)=I,\ u^{\prime}(0)=V,\ t\in(0,T]{\thinspace .}

Discretize this equation according to
:math:`[D_tD_t u + \omega^2 u = f]^n`.

**a)**
Derive the equation for the
first time step (:math:`u^1`).

**b)**
For verification purposes,
we use the method of manufactured solutions (MMS) with the
choice of :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,t)= ct+d`.
Find restrictions on :math:`c` and :math:`d` from
the initial conditions. Compute the corresponding source term :math:`f` by term.
Show that :math:`[D_tD_t t]^n=0` and use the fact
that the :math:`D_tD_t` operator is linear,
:math:`[D_tD_t (ct+d)]^n = c[D_tD_t t]^n + [D_tD_t d]^n = 0`, to show that
:math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}` is also a perfect solution of the discrete equations.

**c)**
Use ``sympy`` to do the symbolic calculations above. Here is a
sketch of the program ``vib_undamped_verify_mms.py``:

.. code-block:: python

        import sympy as sp
        V, t, I, w, dt = sp.symbols('V t I w dt')  # global symbols
        f = None  # global variable for the source term in the ODE

            """Return the terms in the ODE that the source term
            must balance, here u'' + w**2*u.

        def residual_discrete_eq_step1(u):
            """Return the residual of the discrete eq. at the first
            step with u inserted."""

            # Residual in discrete equations (should be 0)

Fill in the various functions such that the calls in the ``main``
function works.

**d)**
The purpose now is to choose a quadratic function
:math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}} = bt^2 + ct + d` as exact solution. Extend the ``sympy``
code above with a function ``quadratic`` for fitting ``f`` and checking
if the discrete equations are fulfilled. (The function is very similar
to ``linear``.)

.. Check with hand calculations that the ``sympy`` implementation

.. is correct.

**e)**
Will a polynomial of degree three fulfill the discrete equations?

**f)**
Implement a ``solver`` function for computing the numerical
solution of this problem.

**g)**
Write a nose test for checking that the quadratic solution
is computed to correctly (too machine precision, but the
round-off errors accumulate and increase with :math:`T`) by the ``solver``
function.

Exercise 2: Show linear growth of the phase with time
-----------------------------------------------------

Consider an exact solution :math:`I\cos (\omega t)` and an
approximation :math:`I\cos(\tilde\omega t)`.
Define the phase error as time lag between the peak :math:`I`
in the exact solution and the corresponding peak in the approximation
after :math:`m` periods of oscillations. Show that this phase error

Exercise 3: Improve the accuracy by adjusting the frequency
-----------------------------------------------------------

According to :ref:`(2.11) <Eq:vib:ode1:tildeomega:series>`, the numerical
frequency deviates from the exact frequency by a (dominating) amount
:math:`\omega^3\Delta t^2/24 >0`. Replace the ``w`` parameter in the algorithm
in the ``solver`` function in ``vib_undamped.py`` by ``w*(1 -
(1./24)*w**2*dt**2`` and test how this adjustment in the numerical
algorithm improves the accuracy (use :math:`\Delta t =0.1` and simulate
for 80 periods, with and without adjustment of :math:`\omega`).

.. _vib:exer:undamped:adaptive:

Exercise 4: See if adaptive methods improve the phase error
-----------------------------------------------------------

Adaptive methods for solving ODEs aim at adjusting :math:`\Delta t` such
that the error is within a user-prescribed tolerance. Implement the
equation :math:`u^{\prime\prime}+u=0` in the `Odespy <https://github.com/hplgit/odespy>`__
software. Use the example `on adaptive
schemes <http://tinyurl.com/opdfafk/pub/sphinx-decay/._main_decay007.html#example-adaptive-runge-kutta-methods>`__
in [Ref1]_.  Run the scheme with a very low
tolerance (say :math:`10^{-14}`) and for a long time, check the number of
time points in the solver's mesh (``len(solver.t_all)``), and compare
the phase error with that produced by the simple finite difference
method from the section :ref:`vib:ode1:fdm` with the same number of (equally
spaced) mesh points. The question is whether it pays off to use an
adaptive solver or if equally many points with a simple method gives
about the same accuracy.

Exercise 5: Use a Taylor polynomial to compute :math:`u^1`
----------------------------------------------------------

As an alternative to the derivation of :ref:`(2.8) <Eq:vib:ode1:step4b>` for
computing :math:`u^1`, one can use a Taylor polynomial with three terms
for :math:`u^1`:

.. math::
         u(t_1) \approx u(0) + u^{\prime}(0)\Delta t + {\frac{1}{2}}u^{\prime\prime}(0)\Delta t^2

With :math:`u^{\prime\prime}=-\omega^2 u` and :math:`u^{\prime}(0)=0`, show that this method also leads to
:ref:`(2.8) <Eq:vib:ode1:step4b>`. Generalize the condition on :math:`u^{\prime}(0)` to
be :math:`u^{\prime}(0)=V` and compute :math:`u^1` in this case with both methods.

Exercise 6: Find the minimal resolution of an oscillatory function
------------------------------------------------------------------

Sketch the function on a given mesh which has the highest possible
frequency. That is, this oscillatory "cos-like" function has its
maxima and minima at every two grid points.  Find an expression for
the frequency of this function, and use the result to find the largest
relevant value of :math:`\omega\Delta t` when :math:`\omega` is the frequency
of an oscillating function and :math:`\Delta t` is the mesh spacing.

.. _vib:exer:fd:exp:plot:

Exercise 7: Visualize the accuracy of finite differences for a cosine function
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. Short: Visualize the accuracy of finite differences

We introduce the error fraction

.. math::
         E = \frac{[D_tD_t u]^n}{u^{\prime\prime}(t_n)} 

to measure the error in the finite difference approximation :math:`D_tD_tu` to
:math:`u^{\prime\prime}`.
Compute :math:`E`
for the specific choice of a cosine/sine function of the
form :math:`u=\exp{(i\omega t)}` and show that

.. math::
         E = \left(\frac{2}{\omega\Delta t}\right)^2
        \sin^2(\frac{\omega\Delta t}{2})
        {\thinspace .}
        

Plot :math:`E` as a function of :math:`p=\omega\Delta t`. The relevant
values of :math:`p` are :math:`[0,\pi]` (see :ref:`vib:exer:wdt:limit`
for why :math:`p>\pi` does not make sense).
The deviation of the curve from unity visualizes the error in the
approximation. Also expand :math:`E` as a Taylor polynomial in :math:`p` up to
fourth degree (use, e.g., ``sympy``).

Exercise 8: Verify convergence rates of the error in energy
-----------------------------------------------------------

We consider the ODE problem :math:`u^{\prime\prime} + \omega^2u=0`, :math:`u(0)=I`, :math:`u^{\prime}(0)=V`,
for :math:`t\in (0,T]`. The total energy of the solution
:math:`E(t)=\frac{1}{2}(u^{\prime})^2 + \frac{1}{2}\omega^2 u^2` should stay
constant.
The error in energy can be computed as explained in
the section :ref:`vib:model1:energy`.

Make a nose test in a file ``test_error_conv.py``, where code from
``vib_undamped.py`` is imported, but the ``convergence_rates`` and
``test_convergence_rates`` functions are copied and modified to also
incorporate computations of the error in energy and the convergence
rate of this error. The expected rate is 2.

Solve the various subproblems and see how the results and problem
settings change with the generalized ODE in case of linear or

.. _vib:exer:quad:damping:fwbw:

Exercise 16: Use the forward-backward scheme with quadratic damping
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We consider the generalized model with quadratic damping, expressed
as a system of two first-order equations as in the section :ref:`vib:ode2:staggered`:

.. math::
        
        u^{\prime} &= v,\\ 
        v' &= \frac{1}{m}\left( F(t) - \beta |v|v - s(u)\right){\thinspace .}
        

However, contrary to what is done in the section :ref:`vib:ode2:staggered`,
we want to apply the idea of the forward-backward discretization
in the section :ref:`vib:model2x2:EulerCromer`. Express the idea in operator
notation and write out the scheme. Unfortunately, the backward
difference for the :math:`v` equation creates a nonlinearity :math:`|v^{n+1}|v^{n}`.
To linearize this nonlinearity, use the known value :math:`v^n` inside
the absolute value factor, i.e., :math:`|v^{n+1}|v^{n}\approx |v^n|v^{n+1}`.
Show that the resulting scheme is equivalent to the one in
the section :ref:`vib:ode2:staggered` for some time level :math:`n\geq 1`.

What we learn from this exercise is that the first-order differences
and the linearization trick play together in "the right way" such that
the scheme is as good as when we (in the section :ref:`vib:ode2:staggered`)
carefully apply centered differences and a geometric mean on a
staggered mesh to achieve second-order accuracy.  There is a
difference in the handling of the initial conditions, though, as
explained at the end of the section :ref:`vib:model2x2:EulerCromer`.

.. _vib:exer:quad:damping:bw:

Exercise 17: Use a backward difference for the damping term
-----------------------------------------------------------

As an alternative to discretizing the damping terms :math:`\beta u^{\prime}` and
:math:`\beta |u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}` by centered differences, we may apply
backward differences:

.. math::
        
        [u^{\prime}]^n &\approx [D_t^-u]^n,\\ 
        & [|u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}]^n &\approx [|D_t^-u|D_t^-u]^n
        = |[D_t^-u]^n|[D_t^-u]^n{\thinspace .}
        

The advantage of the backward difference is that the damping term is
evaluated using known values :math:`u^n` and :math:`u^{n-1}` only.
Extend the `vib.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/vib/vib.py>`__ code with a scheme based
on using backward differences in the damping terms. Add statements
to compare the original approach with centered difference and the
new idea launched in this exercise. Perform numerical experiments
to investigate how much accuracy that is lost by using the backward
differences.

.. _vib:exer:bouncing:ball:

Exercise 18: Simulate a bouncing ball
-------------------------------------

A bouncing ball is a body in free vertically fall until it impacts the
ground. During the impact, some kinetic energy is lost, and a new
motion upwards with reduced velocity starts.  At some point the
velocity close to the ground is so small that the ball is considered
to be finally at rest.

The motion of the ball falling in air is governed by Newton's second
law :math:`F=ma`, where :math:`a` is the acceleration of the body, :math:`m` is the mass,
and :math:`F` is the sum of all forces. Here, we neglect the air resistance
so that gravity :math:`-mg` is the only force. The height of the ball is
denoted by :math:`h` and :math:`v` is the velocity. The relations between :math:`h`, :math:`v`, and
:math:`a`,

.. math::
         h'(t)= v(t),\quad v'(t) = a(t),

combined with Newton's second law gives the ODE model

.. _Eq:vib:exer:bouncing:ball:h2eq:

.. math::
   :label: vib:exer:bouncing:ball:h2eq
        
        h^{\prime\prime}(t) = -g,
        
        

or expressed alternatively as a system of first-order equations:

.. _Eq:vib:exer:bouncing:ball:veq:

.. math::
   :label: vib:exer:bouncing:ball:veq
        
        v'(t) = -g,
         
        

.. _Eq:vib:exer:bouncing:ball:heq:

.. math::
   :label: vib:exer:bouncing:ball:heq
          
        h'(t) = v(t){\thinspace .}
        
        

These equations govern the motion as long as the ball is away from
the ground by a small distance :math:`\epsilon_h > 0`. When :math:`h<\epsilon_h`,
we have two cases.

1. The ball impacts the ground, recognized by a sufficiently large negative
   velocity (:math:`v<-\epsilon_v`). The velocity then changes sign and is
   reduced by a factor :math:`C_R`, known as the `coefficient of restitution <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution>`__.
   For plotting purposes, one may set :math:`h=0`.

2. The motion stops, recognized by a sufficiently small velocity
   (:math:`|v|<\epsilon_v`) close to the ground.

Choose one of the models, :eq:`vib:exer:bouncing:ball:h2eq` or
:eq:`vib:exer:bouncing:ball:veq`-:eq:`vib:exer:bouncing:ball:heq`,
and simulate a bouncing ball. Plot :math:`h(t)`. Think about how to
plot :math:`v(t)`.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
A naive implementation may get stuck in repeated impacts for large time
step sizes. To avoid this situation, one can introduce a state
variable that holds the mode of the motion: free fall, impact, or rest.
Two consecutive impacts imply that the motion has stopped.

.. _vib:exer:elastic:pendulum:

Exercise 19: Simulate an elastic pendulum
-----------------------------------------

Consider an elastic pendulum fixed to the point :math:`\boldsymbol{r}_0=(0,L_0)`.
The length of the pendulum wire when not stretched is :math:`L_0`.
The wire is massless and always straight. At the end point
:math:`\boldsymbol{r}`, we have a mass :math:`m`.
Stretching the elastic wire a distance :math:`s`
gives rise to a spring force :math:`ks` in the opposite direction of the
stretching. Let :math:`\boldsymbol{n}` be a unit normal vector along the wire:

.. math::
         \boldsymbol{n} = \frac{\boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}_0}{||\boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}_0||}{\thinspace .}

The stretch :math:`s` in the wire is the current length :math:`||\boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}_0||`
at some time :math:`t` minus the original length :math:`L_0`:

.. math::
         s = ||\boldsymbol{r}-\boldsymbol{r}_0|| - L_0{\thinspace .}

The force in the wire is then :math:`\boldsymbol{F}_w=-ks\boldsymbol{n}`.
Newton's second law of motion applied to the mass results in

.. _Eq:vib:exer:elastic:pendulum:eq1:

.. math::
   :label: vib:exer:elastic:pendulum:eq1
        
        m\ddot{\boldsymbol{r}} = -ks\boldsymbol{n} - mg\boldsymbol{j},
        
        

where :math:`\boldsymbol{j}` is a unit vector in the upward vertical direction.
Let :math:`\boldsymbol{r}=(x,y)` and :math:`\boldsymbol{n}=(n_x,n_y)`. The two components of
:eq:`vib:exer:elastic:pendulum:eq1` then becomes

.. math::
        
        \ddot x = -m^{-1}ksn_x,
        

.. _Eq:vib:exer:elastic:pendulum:eq2a:

.. math::
   :label: vib:exer:elastic:pendulum:eq2a
          
         
        

.. _Eq:vib:exer:elastic:pendulum:eq2b:

.. math::
   :label: vib:exer:elastic:pendulum:eq2b
          
        \ddot y = - m^{-1}ksn_y - g
        {\thinspace .}
        

The mass point :math:`(x,y)` will undergo a two-dimensional motion, but
if the wire is stiff (large :math:`k`), the elastic pendulum will approach
the classical one where the mass point moves along a circle.
However, the elastic pendulum is modeled by a direct application of
Newton's second law, because the force in the wire is known (as a
function of the motion), while the classical pendulum involves
constrained motion, which requires elimination of an unknown via
the constraint (by invoking polar coordinates).

In equilibrium, the mass hangs in the position :math:`(0,y_0)` determined by

.. math::
         0 = - m^{-1}ksn_y - g = m^{-1}k(y_0-L_0) - g\quad\Rightarrow\quad
        y_0 = L_0 + mg/k = L{\thinspace .}

We then displace the mass an angle :math:`\theta_0` to the right. The initial
position :math:`(x(0),y(0))` then becomes

.. math::
         x(0)=L\sin\theta_0,\quad y(0)=L_0 - L\cos\theta_0{\thinspace .}

The velocity is zero, :math:`x'(0)=y'(0)=0`.

**a)**
Write a code that can simulate such an elastic pendulum. Plot
:math:`y` against :math:`x` in a plot with the same length scale on the
axis such that we get a correct picture of the motion.
Also plot the angle the pendulum: :math:`\theta = \tan^{-1}x/(L_0-y)`.

A possible set of parameters is :math:`L_0=9.81` m, :math:`m=1` kg, :math:`theta_0=30`
degrees.

**Hint 1.**
The associated classical pendulum, for large :math:`k`, has an equation
:math:`\ddot\theta + g/L_0\theta =0`. With :math:`g=L_0`, the period is :math:`2\pi`:
:math:`\theta(t) = \theta_0\cos(t)`. One can compare in a plot the angle
of the elastic solution (:math:`\theta = \tan^{-1}x/(L_0-y)`)
with the solution of the classical pendulum problem.

**Hint 2.**
The equation of motion is subject to round-off errors for large :math:`k`,
because :math:`s` is then small such that :math:`ks` is a product of a large and
a small number. Moreover, in this stiff case,
:math:`m^{-1}ksn_y` is close to :math:`g` such that we
also subtract two almost equal numbers in the force term in the
equation. For the given parameters, :math:`k=150` is a large value and
gives a solution close to the motion of a perfect classical pendulum.
Much larger values gives unstable solutions.

**b)**
Air resistance is a force :math:`\frac{1}{2}\varrho C_D A||bm{v}||\boldsymbol{v}`,
where :math:`C_D` is a drag coefficient (0.2 for a sphere), :math:`\varrho`
is the density of air (1.2 :math:`\hbox{kg }\,{\hbox{m}}^{-3}`), :math:`A` is the
cross section area (:math:`A=\pi R^2` for a sphere, where :math:`R` is the radius),
and :math:`\boldsymbol{v}` is the velocity: :math:`\boldsymbol{v} = \dot{\boldsymbol{r}}`.
Include air resistance in the model and show plots comparing the
motion with and without air resistance.

Exercise 20: Analysis of the Euler-Cromer scheme
------------------------------------------------

The Euler-Cromer scheme for the model problem
:math:`u^{\prime\prime} + \omega^2 u =0`, :math:`u(0)=I`, :math:`u^{\prime}(0)=0`, is given in
:ref:`(2.27) <Eq:vib:model2x2:EulerCromer:ueq1b>`-:ref:`(2.26) <Eq:vib:model2x2:EulerCromer:veq1b>`.
Find the exact discrete solutions of this scheme and show that the solution
for :math:`u^n` coincides with that found in the section :ref:`vib:ode1:analysis`.

**Hint.**
Use an "ansatz" :math:`u^n=I\exp{(i\tilde\omega\Delta t\,n)}` and
:math:`v^=qu^n`, where :math:`\tilde\omega` and :math:`q` are unknown parameters. The formula

.. math::
         \exp{(i\tilde\omega(\Delta t))} + \exp{(i\tilde\omega(-\Delta t))} - 2
        = 2\left(\cosh(i\tilde\omega\Delta t) -1 \right)
        =-4\sin^2(\frac{\tilde\omega\Delta t}{2}),

becomes handy.
