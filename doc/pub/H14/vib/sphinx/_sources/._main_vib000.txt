Note: **PRELIMINARY VERSION** (expect typos)

Vibration problems lead to differential equations with solutions that
oscillate in time, typically in a damped or undamped sinusoidal
fashion.  Such solutions put certain demands on the numerical methods
compared to other phenomena whose solutions are monotone.
Both the frequency and amplitude of the oscillations need to be
accurately handled by the numerical schemes. Most of the reasoning and
specific building blocks introduced in the fortcoming text can be
reused to construct sound methods for partial differential equations
of wave nature in multiple spatial dimensions.
