Implementation  (1)
===================

.. index::
   single: wave equation; 1D, implementation

This section present the complete computational algorithm, its
implementation in Python code, animation of the solution, and
verification of the implementation.

A real implementation of the basic computational algorithm from
the sections :ref:`wave:string:alg` and :ref:`wave:string:impl` can be
encapsulated in a function, taking all the input data for the problem
as arguments.  The physical input data consists of :math:`c`, :math:`I(x)`,
:math:`V(x)`, :math:`f(x,t)`, :math:`L`, and :math:`T`.  The numerical input is the mesh
parameters :math:`\Delta t` and :math:`\Delta x`.

Instead of specifying :math:`\Delta t` *and* :math:`\Delta x`, we can specify one
of them and the Courant number :math:`C` instead, since having explicit
control of the Courant number is convenient when investigating the
numerical method. Many find it natural to prescribe the resolution of
the spatial grid and set :math:`N_x`. The solver function can then compute
:math:`\Delta t = CL/(cN_x)`. However, for comparing :math:`u(x,t)` curves (as
functions of :math:`x`) for various Courant numbers, especially in
animations in time, it is more convenient to keep :math:`\Delta t` fixed for
all :math:`C` and let :math:`\Delta x` vary according to :math:`\Delta x = c\Delta t/C`.
(With :math:`\Delta t` fixed, all frames correspond to the same time :math:`t`,
and plotting curves with different spatial resolution is trivial.)

The solution at all spatial points at a new time level is stored in an
array ``u`` (of length :math:`N_x+1`). We need to decide what do to with
this solution, e.g., visualize the curve, analyze the values, or write
the array to file for later use. The decision what to do is left to
the user in a suppled function

.. code-block:: python

        def user_action(u, x, t, n):

where ``u`` is the solution at the spatial points ``x`` at time ``t[n]``.

Making a solver function
------------------------

A first attempt at a solver function is listed below.

.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import *
        
        def solver(I, V, f, c, L, dt, C, T, user_action=None):
            """Solve u_tt=c^2*u_xx + f on (0,L)x(0,T]."""
            Nt = int(round(T/dt))
            t = linspace(0, Nt*dt, Nt+1)   # Mesh points in time
            dx = dt*c/float(C)
            Nx = int(round(L/dx))
            x = linspace(0, L, Nx+1)       # Mesh points in space
            C2 = C**2                      # Help variable in the scheme
            if f is None or f == 0 :
                f = lambda x, t: 0
            if V is None or V == 0:
                V = lambda x: 0
        
            u   = zeros(Nx+1)   # Solution array at new time level
            u_1 = zeros(Nx+1)   # Solution at 1 time level back
            u_2 = zeros(Nx+1)   # Solution at 2 time levels back
        
            import time;  t0 = time.clock()  # for measuring CPU time
        
            # Load initial condition into u_1
            for i in range(0,Nx+1):
                u_1[i] = I(x[i])
        
            if user_action is not None:
                user_action(u_1, x, t, 0)

            n = 0

                       0.5*C2*(u_1[i-1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i+1]) + \ 
                       0.5*dt**2*f(x[i], t[n])
            u[0] = 0;  u[Nx] = 0
        
            if user_action is not None:
                user_action(u, x, t, 1)
        
            # Switch variables before next step
            u_2[:] = u_1;  u_1[:] = u
        
            for n in range(1, Nt):
                # Update all inner points at time t[n+1]
                for i in range(1, Nx):
                    u[i] = - u_2[i] + 2*u_1[i] + \ 
                             C2*(u_1[i-1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i+1]) + \ 
                             dt**2*f(x[i], t[n])
        
                # Insert boundary conditions
                u[0] = 0;  u[Nx] = 0
                if user_action is not None:
                    if user_action(u, x, t, n+1):
                        break
        
                # Switch variables before next step
                u_2[:] = u_1;  u_1[:] = u
        
            cpu_time = t0 - time.clock()
            return u, x, t, cpu_time

.. Too trivial here:

.. Checking that a solution :math:`u^n_i` stays constant throughout some

.. time steps is often of considerable help in tracking down bugs

.. in an implementation. A constant solution :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}} = Q` fulfills

.. the PDE problem :ref:`(2.12) <Eq:wave:pde2>`-:ref:`(2.16) <Eq:wave:pde2:bc:L>`

.. if :math:`I(x)=Q`, :math:`V=0`, :math:`u(0,t)=u(L,t)=Q`, and :math:`f=0`

            u, x, t, cpu = solver(I, V, f, c, L, dt, C, T)

.. _wave:pde1:impl:animate:

Visualization: animating the solution
-------------------------------------

Now that we have verified the implementation it is time to do a
real computation where we also display the evolution of the waves
on the screen.

Visualization via SciTools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following ``viz`` function defines a ``user_action``
callback function for plotting the solution at each time level:

.. code-block:: python

        def viz(I, V, f, c, L, dt, C, T, umin, umax, animate=True):
            """Run solver and visualize u at each time level."""
            import scitools.std as plt
            import time, glob, os
        
            def plot_u(u, x, t, n):
                """user_action function for solver."""
                plt.plot(x, u, 'r-',
                         xlabel='x', ylabel='u',
                         axis=[0, L, umin, umax],
                         title='t=%f' % t[n], show=True)
                # Let the initial condition stay on the screen for 2
                # seconds, else insert a pause of 0.2 s between each plot
                time.sleep(2) if t[n] == 0 else time.sleep(0.2)
                plt.savefig('frame_%04d.png' % n)  # for movie making
        
            # Clean up old movie frames
            for filename in glob.glob('frame_*.png'):
                os.remove(filename)
        
            user_action = plot_u if animate else None
            u, x, t, cpu = solver(I, V, f, c, L, dt, C, T, user_action)
        
            # Make movie files
            fps = 4  # Frames per second
            plt.movie('frame_*.png', encoder='html', fps=fps,
                      output_file='movie.html')
            codec2ext = dict(flv='flv', libx264='mp4', libvpx='webm',
                             libtheora='ogg')
            filespec = 'frame_%04d.png'
            movie_program = 'avconv'  # or 'ffmpeg'
            for codec in codec2ext:
                ext = codec2ext[codec]
                cmd = '%(movie_program)s -r %(fps)d -i %(filespec)s '\ 
                      '-vcodec %(codec)s movie.%(ext)s' % vars()
                os.system(cmd)

A function inside another function, like ``plot_u`` in the above code
segment, has access to *and remembers* all the local variables
in the surrounding code inside the ``viz`` function (!). This is known
in computer science as a *closure* and is very convenient to
program with. For example,
the ``plt`` and ``time`` modules defined outside ``plot_u`` are accessible for
``plot_u`` when
the function is called (as ``user_action``) in the ``solver`` function.
Some may think, however, that a class instead of a closure is a cleaner
and easier-to-understand implementation of
the user action function, see the section :ref:`wave:pde2:software`.

Making movie files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several hardcopies of the animation are made from the
``frame_*.png`` files. We use
the ``avconv`` (or ``ffmpeg``) programs to combine individual
plot files to movies in modern
formats: Flash, MP4, Webm, and Ogg.
A typical ``avconv`` (or ``ffmpeg``) command for creating a movie file
in Ogg format
with 4 frames per second built from a collection of
plot files with names generated by ``frame_%04d.png``,
look like

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> avconv -r 4 -i frame_%04d.png -c:v libtheora movie.ogg

The different formats require different video encoders (``-c:v``) to
be installed: Flash applies ``flv``, WebM applies ``libvpx``, and MP4
applies ``libx264``:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> avconv -r 4 -i frame_%04d.png -c:v flv movie.flv
        Terminal> avconv -r 4 -i frame_%04d.png -c:v libvpx movie.webm
        Terminal> avconv -r 4 -i frame_%04d.png -c:v libx264 movie.mp4

Players like ``vlc``, ``mplayer``, ``gxine``, and ``totem``
can be used to play these movie files.

Note that padding the frame counter with zeros in the ``frame_*.png``
files, as specified by the ``%04d`` format, is essential so that the wildcard
notation ``frame_*.png`` expands to the correct set of files.

The
``plt.movie`` function also creates a ``movie.html`` file with a movie player
for displaying the ``frame_*.png`` files in a web browser.
This movie player can
be generated from the command line too

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> scitools movie encoder=html output_file=movie.html \ 
                  fps=4 frame_*.png

Skipping frames for animation speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes the time step is small and :math:`T` is large, leading to an
inconveniently large number of plot files and a slow animation on the
screen. The solution to such a problem is to decide on a total number
of frames in the animation, ``num_frames``, and plot the solution only at
every ``every`` frame. The total number of time levels (i.e., maximum
possible number of frames) is the length of ``t``, ``t.size``, and if we
want ``num_frames``, we need to plot every ``t.size/num_frames`` frame:

.. code-block:: python

        every = int(t.size/float(num_frames))
        if n % every == 0 or n == t.size-1:
            st.plot(x, u, 'r-', ...)

The initial condition (``n=0``) is natural to include,
and as ``n % every == 0`` will very seldom be true for the
very final frame, we also ensure that ``n == t.size-1`` and hence
the final frame is included.

A simple choice of numbers may illustrate the formulas: say we have
801 frames in total (``t.size``) and we allow only 60 frames to be
plotted. Then we need to plot every 801/60 frame, which with integer
division yields 13 as ``every``. Using the mod function, ``n % every``,
this operation is zero every time ``n`` can be divided by 13 without a
remainder. That is, the ``if`` test is true when ``n`` equals :math:`0, 13, 26,
39, ..., 780, 801`. The associated code is included in the ``plot_u``
function in the file `wave1D_u0v.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_u0v.py>`__.

Visualization via Matplotlib
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The previous code based on the ``plot`` interface from ``scitools.std``
can be run with Matplotlib as the visualization backend, but if one
desires to program directly with Matplotlib, quite different code
is needed. Matplotlib's interactive mode must be turned on:

.. code-block:: python

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        plt.ion()  # interactive mode on

The most
commonly used animation technique with Matplotlib
is to update the data in the plot at each time level:

.. code-block:: python

        # Make a first plot
        lines = plt.plot(t, u)
        # call plt.axis, plt.xlabel, plt.ylabel, etc. as desired
        
        # At later time levels
        lines[0].set_ydata(u)
        plt.legend('t=%g' % t[n])
        plt.draw()  # make updated plot
        plt.savefig(...)

An alternative is to rebuild the plot at every time level:

.. code-block:: python

        plt.clf()        # delete any previous curve(s)
        plt.axis([...])
        plt.plot(t, u)
        # plt.xlabel, plt.legend and other decorations
        plt.draw()
        plt.savefig(...)

Many prefer to work with figure and axis objects as in MATLAB:

.. code-block:: python

        fig = plt.figure()
        ...
        fig.clf()
        ax = fig.gca()
        ax.axis(...)
        ax.plot(t, u)
        # ax.set_xlabel, ax.legend and other decorations
        plt.draw()
        fig.savefig(...)

.. _wave:pde1:guitar:data:

Running a case
--------------

The first demo of our 1D wave equation solver concerns vibrations of a
string that is initially deformed to a triangular shape, like when picking
a guitar string:

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:guitar:I:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:guitar:I
        
        I(x) = \left\lbrace
        \begin{array}{ll}
        ax/x_0, & x < x_0,\\ 
        a(L-x)/(L-x_0), & \hbox{otherwise}
        \end{array}\right.
        
        

We choose :math:`L=75` cm, :math:`x_0=0.8L`, :math:`a=5` mm, and a time frequency
:math:`\nu = 440` Hz. The relation between the wave speed :math:`c` and :math:`\nu` is
:math:`c=\nu\lambda`, where :math:`\lambda` is the wavelength, taken as :math:`2L` because
the longest wave on the string form half a wavelength. There is no
external force, so :math:`f=0`, and the string is at rest initially so
that :math:`V=0`.

Regarding numerical parameters, we need to specify a :math:`\Delta t`.
Sometimes it is more natural to think of a spatial resolution instead
of a time step. A natural semi-coarse spatial resolution in the present
problem is :math:`N_x=50`. We can then choose the associated :math:`\Delta t` (as required
by the ``viz`` and ``solver`` functions) as the stability limit:
:math:`\Delta t = L/(N_xc)`. This is the :math:`\Delta t` to be specified,
but notice that if :math:`C<1`, the actual :math:`\Delta x` computed in ``solver`` gets
larger than :math:`L/N_x`: :math:`\Delta x = c\Delta t/C = L/(N_xC)`. (The reason
is that we fix :math:`\Delta t` and adjust :math:`\Delta x`, so if :math:`C` gets
smaller, the code implements this effect in terms of a larger :math:`\Delta x`.)

A function for setting the physical and numerical parameters and
calling ``viz`` in this application goes as follows:

.. code-block:: python

        def guitar(C):
            """Triangular wave (pulled guitar string)."""
            L = 0.75
            x0 = 0.8*L
            a = 0.005
            freq = 440
            wavelength = 2*L
            c = freq*wavelength
            omega = 2*pi*freq
            num_periods = 1
            T = 2*pi/omega*num_periods
            # Choose dt the same as the stability limit for Nx=50
            dt = L/50./c
        
            def I(x):
                return a*x/x0 if x < x0 else a/(L-x0)*(L-x)
        
            umin = -1.2*a;  umax = -umin
            cpu = viz(I, 0, 0, c, L, dt, C, T, umin, umax, animate=True)

The associated program has the name `wave1D_u0.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_u0.py>`__. Run
the program and watch the `movie of the vibrating string <http://tinyurl.com/opdfafk/pub/mov-wave/guitar_C0.8/index.html>`__.

The benefits of scaling
-----------------------

The previous example demonstrated that quite some work is needed
with establishing relevant physical parameters for a case. By *scaling*
the mathematical problem we can often reduce the need to estimate
physical parameters dramatically. A scaling consists of introducing new
independent and dependent variables, with the aim that the absolute
value of these vary between 0 and 1:

.. math::
         \bar x = \frac{x}{L},\quad \bar t = \frac{c}{L}t,\quad
        \bar u = \frac{u}{a}
        {\thinspace .}
        

Replacing old by new variables in the PDE, using :math:`f=0`,
and dropping the bars, results in the *scaled equation*
:math:`u_{tt} = u_{xx}`. This equation has no physical parameter (!).

If we have a program implemented for the physical wave equation with
dimensions, we can obtain the dimensionless, scaled version by
setting :math:`c=1`. The initial condition
corresponds to :ref:`(11.19) <Eq:wave:pde1:guitar:I>`, but with setting
:math:`a=1`, :math:`L=1`, and :math:`x_0\in [0,1]`. This means that we only need to
decide on the :math:`x_0` value as a fraction of unity, because
the scaled problem corresponds to setting all
other parameters to unity! In the code we can just set
``a=c=L=1``, ``x0=0.8``, and there is no need to calculate with
wavelengths and frequencies to estimate :math:`c`.

The only non-trivial parameter to estimate in the scaled problem
is the final end time of the simulation, or more precisely, how it relates
to periods in periodic solutions in time, since we often want to
express the end time as a certain number of periods.
Suppose as :math:`u` behaves as :math:`\sin (\omega t)` in time in variables
with dimension. The corresponding period is :math:`P=2\pi/\omega`.
The frequency :math:`\omega` is related to the wavelength :math:`\lambda` of the waves
through the relations :math:`\omega = kc` and :math:`k=2\pi/\lambda`, giving
:math:`\omega = 2\pi c/\lambda` and :math:`P=\lambda/c`. It remains to estimate :math:`\lambda`.
With :math:`u(x,t)=F(x)\sin\omega t` we find from :math:`u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx}`
that :math:`c^2F'' + \omega^2F=0`, and the boundary conditions demand
:math:`F(0)=F(L)=0`. The solution is :math:`F(x)=\sin(x\pi/L)`, which has
wavelength :math:`\lambda = 2\pi/(\pi/L)=2L`. One period is therefore
given by :math:`P=2L/c`. The dimensionless period is :math:`\bar P=Pc/L = 2`.

Vectorization
=============

.. index:: vectorization

The computational algorithm for solving the wave equation visits one
mesh point at a time and evaluates a formula for the new value :math:`u_i^{n+1}`
at
that point. Technically, this is implemented by a loop over array
elements in a program. Such loops may run slowly in Python (and
similar interpreted languages such as R and MATLAB).
One technique for speeding up loops is to
perform operations on entire arrays instead of working with one element
at a time. This is referred to as *vectorization*, *vector computing*,
or *array computing*.
Operations on whole arrays are possible if the computations
involving each element is independent of each other and therefore can,
at least in principle, be performed simultaneously.
Vectorization not only speeds up the code on serial computers, but it
also makes it easy to exploit parallel computing.

.. _wave:pde1:impl:vec:slices:basics:

Operations on slices of arrays
------------------------------

.. index:: scalar code

.. index:: array slices

.. index:: slice

Efficient computing with ``numpy`` arrays demands that we avoid loops
and compute with entire arrays at once (or at least large portions of them).
Consider this calculation of differences :math:`d_i = u_{i+1}-u_i`:

.. code-block:: python

        n = u.size
        for i in range(0, n-1):
            d[i] = u[i+1] - u[i]

All the differences here are independent of each other.
The computation of ``d`` can therefore alternatively be done by
subtracting the array :math:`(u_0,u_1,\ldots,u_{n-1})` from
the array where the elements are shifted one index upwards:
:math:`(u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_n)`, see Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:vec:fig1`.
The former subset of the array can be
expressed by ``u[0:n-1]``,
``u[0:-1]``, or just
``u[:-1]``, meaning from index 0 up to,
but not including, the last element (``-1``). The latter subset
is obtained by ``u[1:n]`` or ``u[1:]``,
meaning from index 1 and the rest of the array.
The computation of ``d`` can now be done without an explicit Python loop:

.. code-block:: python

        d = u[1:] - u[:-1]

or with explicit limits if desired:

.. code-block:: python

        d = u[1:n] - u[0:n-1]

Indices with a colon, going from an index to (but not including) another
index are called *slices*. With ``numpy`` arrays, the computations
are still done by loops, but in efficient, compiled, highly optimized code
in C or Fortran. Such array operations can also easily be distributed
among many processors on parallel computers. We say that the *scalar code*
above, working on an element (a scalar) at a time, has been replaced by
an equivalent *vectorized code*. The process of vectorizing code is called
*vectorization*.

   *Illustration of subtracting two slices of two arrays*


.. admonition:: Test the understanding

   Newcomers to vectorization are encouraged to choose
   a small array ``u``, say with five elements,
   and simulate with pen and paper
   both the loop version and the vectorized version.




Finite difference schemes basically contains differences between array
elements with shifted indices. Consider the updating formula

.. code-block:: python

        for i in range(1, n-1):
            u2[i] = u[i-1] - 2*u[i] + u[i+1]

The vectorization consists of replacing the loop by arithmetics on
slices of arrays of length ``n-2``:

.. code-block:: python

        u2 = u[:-2] - 2*u[1:-1] + u[2:]
        u2 = u[0:n-2] - 2*u[1:n-1] + u[2:n]   # alternative

Note that ``u2`` here gets length ``n-2``. If ``u2`` is already an array of
length ``n`` and we want to use the formula to update all the "inner"
elements of ``u2``, as we will when solving a 1D wave equation, we can write

.. code-block:: python

        u2[1:-1]  = u[:-2] - 2*u[1:-1] + u[2:]
        u2[1:n-1] = u[0:n-2] - 2*u[1:n-1] + u[2:n]   # alternative

Pen and paper calculations with a small array will demonstrate what is
actually going on. The expression on the right-hand side are done in the
following steps, involving temporary arrays with intermediate results,
since we can only work with two arrays at a time in
arithmetic expressions:

.. code-block:: python

        temp1 = 2*u[1:-1]
        temp2 = u[0:-2] - temp1
        temp3 = temp2 + u[2:]
        u2[1:-1] = temp3

We can extend the previous example to a formula with an additional term computed
by calling a function:

.. code-block:: python

        def f(x):
            return x**2 + 1
        
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            u2[i] = u[i-1] - 2*u[i] + u[i+1] + f(x[i])

Assuming ``u2``, ``u``, and ``x`` all have length ``n``, the vectorized
version becomes

.. code-block:: python

        u2[1:-1] = u[:-2] - 2*u[1:-1] + u[2:] + f(x[1:-1])

.. _wave:pde1:impl:vec:slices:fdm:

Finite difference schemes expressed as slices
---------------------------------------------

We now have the necessary tools to vectorize the algorithm for
the wave equation. There are three loops: one for the initial condition,
one for the first time step, and finally the loop that is repeated for
all subsequent time levels. Since only the latter is repeated a potentially
large number of times, we limit the efforts of vectorizing the code
to this loop:

.. code-block:: python

        for i in range(1, Nx):
            u[i] = 2*u_1[i] - u_2[i] + \ 
                   C2*(u_1[i-1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i+1])

The vectorized version becomes

.. code-block:: python

        u[1:-1] = - u_2[1:-1] + 2*u_1[1:-1] + \ 
                  C2*(u_1[:-2] - 2*u_1[1:-1] + u_1[2:])

or

.. code-block:: python

        u[1:Nx] = 2*u_1[1:Nx]- u_2[1:Nx] + \ 
                  C2*(u_1[0:Nx-1] - 2*u_1[1:Nx] + u_1[2:Nx+1])

.. We may vectorize the other loops regarding the initial condition and

.. the first time step, but the effect will hardly be

.. noticeable in long time simulations.

The program
`wave1D_u0v.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_u0v.py>`__
contains a new version of the function ``solver`` where both the scalar
and the vectorized loops are included (the argument ``version`` is
set to ``scalar`` or ``vectorized``, respectively).

.. _wave:pde1:impl:vec:verify:quadratic:

Verification  (2)
-----------------

.. index:: lambda function (Python)

We may reuse the quadratic solution :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,t)=x(L-x)(1+{\frac{1}{2}}t)` for
verifying also the vectorized code. A nose test can now test
both the scalar and the vectorized version. Moreover, we may
use a ``user_action`` function that compares the computed and exact
solution at each time level and performs a test:

.. code-block:: python

        def test_quadratic():
            """
            Check the scalar and vectorized versions work for
            a quadratic u(x,t)=x(L-x)(1+t/2) that is exactly reproduced.

            u_exact = lambda x, t: x*(L - x)*(1 + 0.5*t)
            I = lambda x: u_exact(x, 0)
            V = lambda x: 0.5*u_exact(x, 0)
            # f is a scalar (zeros_like(x) works for scalar x too)
            f = lambda x, t: zeros_like(x) + 2*c**2*(1 + 0.5*t)

            solver(I, V, f, c, L, dt, C, T,
                   user_action=assert_no_error, version='scalar')
            solver(I, V, f, c, L, dt, C, T,
                   user_action=assert_no_error, version='vectorized')


.. admonition:: Lambda functions

   The code segment above demonstrates how to achieve very
   compact code with the use of lambda functions for the various
   input parameters that require a Python function. In essence,
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           f = lambda x, t: L*(x-t)**2
   
   is equivalent to
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           def f(x, t):
               return L(x-t)**2
   
   Note that lambda functions can just contain a single expression and no
   statements.
   
   One advantage with lambda functions is that they can be used directly
   in calls:
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           solver(I=lambda x: sin(pi*x/L), V=0, f=0, ...)




Efficiency measurements
-----------------------

Running the ``wave1D_u0v.py`` code with the previous string vibration example
for :math:`N_x=50,100,200,400,800`, and measuring the CPU time
(see the ``run_efficiency_experiments`` function), shows that the vectorized
code runs substantially faster: the scalar code uses approximately
a factor :math:`N_x/5` more time!

.. _wave:pde1:impl:ref:switch:

Remark on the updating of arrays
--------------------------------

At the end of each time step we need to update the ``u_2`` and ``u_1``
arrays such that they have the right content for the next time step:

.. code-block:: python

        u_2[:] = u_1
        u_1[:] = u

The order here is important! (Updating ``u_1`` first, makes ``u_2`` equal
to ``u``, which is wrong.)

The assignment ``u_1[:] = u`` copies the content of the ``u`` array into
the elements of the ``u_1`` array. Such copying takes time, but
little compared to computing ``u`` from the finite difference formula,
even when the formula has a vectorized implementation.
However, efficiency of program code is a key topic when solving
PDEs numerically, so it must be mentioned that there exists a
much more efficient way of making the arrays ``u_2`` and ``u_1``
ready for the next time step. The idea is based on *switching
references* and explained below.

A Python variable is actually a reference to some object (C programmers
may think of pointers). Instead of copying data, we can let ``u_2``
refer to the ``u_1`` object and ``u_1`` refer to the ``u`` object.
A naive implementation like

.. code-block:: python

        u_2 = u_1
        u_1 = u

will fail, however, because now ``u_1`` and ``u`` refers to the same
object and the update of ``u`` from the finite difference formula
at the next time step will overwrite ``u_1`` and lead to erroneous
computations. Also, with the suggested change of references, the
reference to the ``u_2`` array is lost, and we have in fact only
two arrays. The solution to this problem is to ensure that ``u``
points to the ``u_2`` array. This is mathematically wrong, but
new correct values will be filled into ``u`` at the next time step.

The correct switch of references is then

.. code-block:: python

        tmp = u_2
        u_2 = u_1
        u_1 = u
        u = tmp

We can get rid of the temporary reference ``tmp`` by writing

.. code-block:: python

        u_2, u_1, u = u_1, u, u_2

This update will be used in later implementations.


.. admonition:: Caution

   The update ``u_2, u_1, u = u_1, u, u_2`` leaves wrong content in ``u``
   at the final time step. This means that if we return ``u``, as we
   do in the example codes here, we actually return ``u_2``, which is
   obviously wrong. It is therefore important to adjust the content
   of ``u`` to ``u = u_1`` before returning ``u``.

Exercises  (1)

.. _wave:exer:standingwave:

Exercise 1: Simulate a standing wave
------------------------------------

The purpose of this exercise is to simulate standing waves on :math:`[0,L]`
and illustrate the error in the simulation.
Standing waves arise from an initial condition

.. math::
         u(x,0)= A \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{L}mx\right),

where :math:`m` is an integer and :math:`A` is a freely chosen amplitude.
The corresponding exact solution can be computed and reads

.. math::
         {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,t) =  A\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{L}mx\right)
        \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{L}mct\right){\thinspace .}
        

**a)**
Explain that for a function :math:`\sin kx\cos \omega t` the wave length
in space is :math:`\lambda = 2\pi /k` and the period in time is :math:`P=2\pi/\omega`.
Use these expressions to find the wave length in space and period in
time of :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}` above.

**b)**
Import the ``solver`` function ``wave1D_u0.py`` into a new file
where the ``viz`` function is reimplemented such that it
plots either the numerical *and* the exact solution, *or* the error.

**c)**
Make animations where you illustrate how the error
:math:`e^n_i ={u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x_i, t_n)- u^n_i`
develops and increases in time. Also make animations of
:math:`u` and :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}` simultaneously.

**Hint 1.**
Quite long time simulations are needed in order to display significant
discrepancies between the numerical and exact solution.

**Hint 2.**
A possible set of parameters is :math:`L=12`, :math:`m=9`, :math:`c=2`, :math:`A=1`, :math:`N_x=80`,
:math:`C=0.8`. The error mesh function :math:`e^n` can be simulated for 10 periods,
while 20-30 periods are needed to show significant differences between
the curves for the numerical and exact solution.

.. Closing remarks for this Exercise

Remarks  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The important
parameters for numerical quality are :math:`C` and :math:`k\Delta x`, where
:math:`C=c\Delta t/\Delta x` is the Courant number and :math:`k` is defined above
(:math:`k\Delta x` is proportional to how many mesh points we have per wave length
in space, see the section :ref:`wave:pde1:num:dispersion` for explanation).

.. _wave:exer:store:list:

Exercise 2: Add storage of solution in a user action function
-------------------------------------------------------------

Extend the ``plot_u`` function in the file ``wave1D_u0.py`` to also store
the solutions ``u`` in a list.
To this end, declare ``all_u`` as
an empty list in the ``viz`` function, outside ``plot_u``, and perform
an append operation inside the ``plot_u`` function. Note that a
function, like ``plot_u``, inside another function, like ``viz``,
remembers all local variables in ``viz`` function, including ``all_u``,
even when ``plot_u`` is called (as ``user_action``) in the ``solver`` function.
Test both ``all_u.append(u)`` and ``all_u.append(u.copy())``.
Why does one of these constructions fail to store the solution correctly?
Let the ``viz`` function return the ``all_u`` list
converted to a two-dimensional ``numpy`` array.

Exercise 3: Use a class for the user action function
----------------------------------------------------

Redo :ref:`wave:exer:store:list` using a class for the
user action function. That is, define a class ``Action`` where
the ``all_u`` list is an attribute, and implement the user action
function as a method (the special method ``__call__`` is a natural
choice). The class versions avoids that the user action function
depends on parameters defined outside the function (such as ``all_u``
in :ref:`wave:exer:store:list`).

.. _wave:exer:multiple:C:

Exercise 4: Compare several Courant numbers in one movie
--------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this exercise is to make movies where several curves,
corresponding to different Courant numbers, are visualized.
Import the ``solver`` function from the ``wave1D_u0_s`` movie
in a new file ``wave_compare.py``. Reimplement the ``viz`` function
such that it can take a list of ``C`` values as argument
and create a movie with solutions corresponding to the given ``C``
values. The ``plot_u`` function must be changed to store the solution
in an array (see :ref:`wave:exer:store:list` or
:ref:`wave:exer:store:list:class` for details), ``solver`` must be
computed for each value of the Courant number, and finally
one must run through each time step and plot all the spatial
solution curves in one figure and store it in a file.

The challenge in such a visualization is to ensure that the curves in
one plot corresponds to the same time point. The easiest remedy is to
keep the time and space resolution constant and change the wave
velocity :math:`c` to change the Courant number.

Project 5: Calculus with 1D mesh functions
------------------------------------------

This project explores integration and differentiation of
mesh functions, both with scalar and vectorized implementations.
We are given a mesh function :math:`f_i` on a spatial one-dimensional
mesh :math:`x_i=i\Delta x`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`, over the interval :math:`[a,b]`.

**a)**
Define the discrete derivative of :math:`f_i` by using centered
differences at internal mesh points and one-sided differences
at the end points. Implement a scalar version of
the computation in a Python function and supply a nose test
for the linear case :math:`f(x)=4x-2.5` where the discrete derivative should
be exact.

**b)**
Vectorize the implementation of the discrete derivative.
Extend the nose test to check the validity of the implementation.

**c)**
To compute the discrete integral :math:`F_i` of :math:`f_i`, we assume that
the mesh function :math:`f_i` varies linearly between the mesh points.
Let :math:`f(x)` be such a linear interpolant of :math:`f_i`. We then
have

.. math::
         F_i = \int_{x_0}^{x_i} f(x) dx{\thinspace .}

The exact integral of a piecewise linear function :math:`f(x)` is
given by the Trapezoidal rule. S
how that if :math:`F_{i}` is already computed, we can find :math:`F_{i+1}`
from

.. math::
         F_{i+1} = F_i + \frac{1}{2}(f_i + f_{i+1})\Delta x{\thinspace .}

Make a function for a scalar implementation of the discrete integral
as a mesh function. That is, the function should return
:math:`F_i` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`.
For a nose test one can use the fact that the above defined
discrete integral of a linear
function (say :math:`f(x)=4x-2.5`) is exact.

**d)**
Vectorize the implementation of the discrete integral.
Extend the nose test to check the validity of the implementation.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
Interpret the recursive formula for :math:`F_{i+1}` as a sum.
Make an array with each element of the sum and use the "cumsum"
(``numpy.cumsum``) operation to compute the accumulative sum:
``numpy.cumsum([1,3,5])`` is ``[1,4,9]``.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

**e)**
Create a class ``MeshCalculus`` that can integrate and differentiate
mesh functions. The class can just define some methods that call
the previously implemented Python functions. Here is an example
on the usage:

.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        calc = MeshCalculus(vectorized=True)
        x = np.linspace(0, 1, 11)        # mesh
        f = np.exp(x)                    # mesh function
        df = calc.differentiate(f, x)    # discrete derivative
        F = calc.integrate(f, x)         # discrete anti-derivative
