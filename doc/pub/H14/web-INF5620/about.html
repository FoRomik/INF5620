<h2 id="___sec0">Goal: reliable hands-on computing with PDEs </h2>

<p>
When you encounter a partial differential equation, you will after
this course have a clear idea of

<ul>
  <li> how to view the problem as an assemply of smaller/simplified pieces</li>
  <li> how to formulate a finite difference or finite element method
    for the problem</li>
  <li> how to implement the numerical method in a program</li>
  <li> how to verify that the numerical computations are correct</li>
  <li> how to estimate the reliability of numerical simulations, and
    in particular discover non-physical numerical artifacts</li>
  <li> how different sources of errors play together</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec1">Teaching method: simplify, understand, generalize </h2>

<p>
To take advantage of the true power of mathematics in physics,
biology, and other applied sciences, one needs to <em>simplify</em>,
<em>understand</em>, and <em>generalize</em>.  These three concepts also form the
teaching basis in this course.

<p>
A series of physical model problems are addressed and used in examples:

<ul>
 <li> exponential decay</li>
 <li> vibrating systems</li>
 <li> diffusion</li>
 <li> wave motion</li>
 <li> viscous flow</li>
 <li> coupled flow, deformation, transport, and/or heat transfer</li>
</ul>

For each model problem, we start out with the simplest version of the
model and go through key building blocks for turning the computer into
a virtual laboratory where we can play around with the model. The
building blocks covered in the course are

<ul>
 <li> discretization of the model (finite <em>difference</em>, <em>element</em>, volume;
   staggered grids, mixed spaces; discontinuous Galerkin methods)</li>
 <li> methods for nonlinear differential equations</li>
 <li> implementation of the discrete model
   (from scratch in 1D, using tools like FEniCS for 2D/3D)</li>
 <li> programming tools: Python, Cython, Python-F77/C++ (via f2py, Cython, or
   Instant), FEniCS, nose/pytest, SymPy</li>
 <li> verification of the implementation</li>
 <li> analysis of the discrete model: exact (Fourier) solutions, trunction error</li>
 <li> understanding what can go wrong (numerical artifacts)</li>
 <li> extensions, generalizations, real applications</li>
 <li> scaling, real data with units</li>
 <li> parallel computing</li>
 <li> report writing (LaTeX, HTML/MathJax, Sphinx), reproducibility,
   Git version control, GitHub project hosting service</li>
</ul>

Much focus is on <em>all the nuts and bolts of building reliable
simulation models</em>. This means a particular focus on implementation
and testing, and less focus on mathematical subjects that do not
have a direct application of great practical value.

<p>
When teaching new methods, we always start out with simple ODEs to
explain the very basics of the technicalities. Then we extend the
methodology progressively using more advanecd models that build on
what we have learned through the simpler ones.  In this way, new
mathematical or programming techniques are introduced in problems of
the simplest possible type (but no simpler!), yet of a relevance that
carries directly over to advanced PDE problems.

<p>
Through the <em>simplify</em>, <em>understand</em>, and <em>generalize</em> paradigm, one
will view a complex scientific application as an assembly of pieces
that can be understood separately and then brought together (perhaps
with considerable efforts!) to solve the problem in a reliable way.
Our focus throughout the course is two-fold: 1) how to do it, and 2)
how to assess the quality.

<h2 id="___sec2">Compulsory exercises and projects </h2>

<ol>
<li> Smaller exercises. Announced
   on the <a href="lectures.html" target="_blank">overview of lectures</a> page and under
   messages on the <a href="main.html" target="_blank">main page</a>. Note: Students <em>must</em> meet
   in the announced lecture, groups of three are automatically formed,
   each group discusses and provides feedback on three exercises from
   three other students.</li>
<li> A 2D wave equation solver with finite differences, programmed from
   scratch. The project will be published around Sep 20, with
   deadline and assessment in groups on Oct 13.</li>
<li> A nonlinear finite element application of choice, programmed in the
   FEniCS system. A default project is available soon. Deadline
   and assessment in groups on Dec 2.</li>
</ol>

These exercises and projects are delivered in a github.com repo
and assessed in groups of three in the lectures (under guidance).
Each student must perform the two projects in item 2 and 3,
and participate in 3 (out of 5-6)
assessment events with smaller exercises (item 1).

<h2 id="___sec3">Files for the course </h2>

<p>
All example codes are available from
<a href="https://github.com/hplgit/num-methods-for-PDEs/tree/master/src" target="_blank"><tt>https://github.com/hplgit/num-methods-for-PDEs/tree/master/src</tt></a>.
All written course material (textbook chapters and lectures) are
available at
<a href="http://hplgit.github.io/num-methods-for-PDEs/doc/pub/index.html" target="_blank"><tt>http://hplgit.github.io/num-methods-for-PDEs/doc/pub/index.html</tt></a>.

<p>
You may access these resources directly on the web, or you may have
a local copy on your computer:

<p>

<!-- code=text (!bc sys) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Terminal&gt; git clone https://github.com/hplgit/num-methods-for-PDEs.git INF5620-resources
</pre></div>
<p>
This gives you a directory <code>INF5620-resources</code> with all the
published course material. The written material is in <code>doc/pub</code> and
the computer codes in <code>src</code>. As the material undergoes updates throughout
the course, you must frequently get these updates by going to the
<code>INF5620-resources</code> project and doing

<p>

<!-- code=text (!bc sys) typeset with pygments style "default" -->
<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Terminal&gt; git pull origin master
</pre></div>
<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger alert-text-normal"><b>Warning.</b>
The GitHub project <code>num-methods-for-PDEs</code> is automatically generated
from source files in another project. Therefore, if you see some
typo or error, <em>do not</em> fork the project, correct the file and send
me a pull request, which would be the normal procedure to contribute
to file development with Git. Report the error instead in email to
<a href="mailto:hpl@ifi.uio.no" target="_blank"><tt>hpl@ifi.uio.no</tt></a> since the error must
be corrected in the source files that generate the
published files in the <code>num-methods-for-PDEs</code> project.
</div>


<h2 id="___sec4">Exam </h2>

<p>
There will be an oral exam. Two weeks prior to the exam six topics
(exercises) are announced. For each topic you must prepare a 20 min
talk (without any aids). In the exam room, you throw a die and the
number of eyes determines which topic you are to present.
You will get some questions after the presentation, about the
selected topic or from the five other topics. You will not get
questions beyond the given six topics.

<p>
See <a href="http://hplgit.github.io/num-methods-for-PDEs/doc/pub/exam/index.html" target="_blank">previous exams</a> for examples on topics for the final exam.
