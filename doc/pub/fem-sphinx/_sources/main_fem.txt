Basic finite element methods
============================

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen

:Date: Dec 12, 2012

Note: **QUITE PRELIMINARY VERSION**







The finite element method is a powerful tool for solving differential
equations, especially in complicated domains and where higher-order
approximations are desired. Figure :ref:`fem:motivation:fig:dolfin` shows
a two-dimensional domain with a non-trivial geometry. The idea is to
divide the domain into triangles (elements) and seek a polynomial approximations
to the unknown functions on each triangle. The method glues these
piecewise approximations together to find a global solution.
Linear and quadratic polynomials over the triangles are particularly
popular.

.. ========= Principles and machinery for approximating functions =========



Many successful numerical methods for differential equations,
including the finite element method,
aim at approximating the unknown function by a sum


.. math::
   :label: fem:u
        
         u(x) = \sum_{i=0}^N c_i{\varphi}_i(x),
        
        

where :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` are prescribed functions and :math:`c_i`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`,
are unknown coefficients to be determined.
Solution methods for differential equations
utilizing :eq:`fem:u` must
have a *principle* for constructing :math:`N+1` equations to
determine :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`. Then there is a *machinery* regarding
the actual constructions of the equations for :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` in a
particular problem. Finally, there is a *solve* phase for computing
the solution :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` of the :math:`N+1` equations.

Especially in the finite element method, the machinery for constructing
the discrete equations to be implemented on a computer is quite
comprehensive, with many mathematical and implementational
details entering the scene at the
same time. From an ease-of-learning perspective it can therefore be
wise to introduce the computational machinery for a trivial equation:
:math:`u=f`. Solving this equation with :math:`f` given and :math:`u` on the form
:eq:`fem:u` means that we seek an approximation
:math:`u` to :math:`f`.
This approximation problem has the advantage of introducing most of the
finite element toolbox, but with postponing demanding topics related to
differential equations (e.g., integration by parts, boundary conditions,
and coordinate mappings).
This is the reason why we shall first become familiar
with finite element *approximation* before addressing
finite element methods for differential equations.

First, we refresh some linear algebra concepts about approximating
vectors in vector spaces. Second, we extend these concepts to
approximating functions in function spaces, using the same
principles and the same notation.
We present examples on approximating functions by  global basis functions with
support throughout the entire domain.
Third, we introduce the finite element type of local basis functions
and explain the computational algorithms for working with such functions.
Three types of approximation principles are covered: 1) the least squares
method, 2) the Galerkin or :math:`L_2` projection method,
and 3) interpolation or collocation.

.. _fem:approx:vec:

Approximation of vectors
========================

We shall start with introducing two fundamental methods for
determining the coefficients :math:`c_i` in :eq:`fem:u` and illustrate
the methods on approximation of vectors, because vectors in vector
spaces is more intuitive than working with functions in function spaces.
The extension from vectors to functions will be trivial as soon as
the fundamental ideas are understood.


The first method of approximation is called the *least squares method*
and consists in finding :math:`c_i` such that the difference :math:`u-f`, measured
in some norm, is minimized. That is, we aim at finding the best
approximation :math:`u` to :math:`f` (in some norm). The second method is not
as intuitive: we find :math:`u` such that the error :math:`u-f` is orthogonal to
the space where we seek :math:`u`. This is known as *projection*, or
we may also call it a *Galerkin method*.
When approximating vectors and functions, the two methods are
equivalent, but this is no longer the case when working with differential
equations.

Approximation of planar vectors
-------------------------------

.. index::
   single: approximation; of vectors in the plane



Suppose we have given a vector :math:`\pmb{f} = (3,5)` in the :math:`xy` plane
and that we want to approximate this vector by a vector aligned
in the direction of the vector :math:`(a,b)`. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:vec:plane:fig`
depicts the situation.


.. _fem:approx:vec:plane:fig:

.. figure:: fig-fem/vecapprox_plane.png
   :width: 400

   *Approximation of a two-dimensional vector by a one-dimensional vector*


We introduce the vector space :math:`V`
spanned by the vector :math:`\pmb{\varphi}_0=(a,b)`:


.. math::
        
        V = \mbox{span}\,\{ \pmb{\varphi}_0\}\thinspace . 

We say that :math:`\pmb{\varphi}_0` is a basis vector in the space :math:`V`.
Our aim is to find the vector :math:`\pmb{u} = c_0\pmb{\varphi}_0\in V` which best approximates
the given vector :math:`\pmb{f} = (3,5)`. A reasonable criterion for a best
approximation could be to minimize the length of the difference between
the approximate :math:`\pmb{u}` and the given :math:`\pmb{f}`. The difference, or error,
:math:`\pmb{e} = \pmb{f} -\pmb{u}` has its length given by the *norm*


.. math::
         ||\pmb{e}|| = (\pmb{e},\pmb{e})^{\frac{1}{2}},

where :math:`(\pmb{e},\pmb{e})` is the *inner product* of :math:`\pmb{e}` and itself. The inner
product, also called *scalar product* or *dot product*, of two vectors
:math:`\pmb{u}=(u_0,u_1)` and :math:`\pmb{v} =(v_0,v_1)` is defined as


.. math::
        
        (\pmb{u}, \pmb{v}) = u_0v_0 + u_1v_1\thinspace . 


*Remark 1.* We should point out that we use the notation
:math:`(\cdot,\cdot)` for two different things:
:math:`(a,b)` for scalar quantities :math:`a` and :math:`b` means the vector starting in
the origin and ending in the point :math:`(a,b)`, while :math:`(\pmb{u},\pmb{v})` with
vectors :math:`\pmb{u}` and :math:`\pmb{v}` means the inner product of these vectors.
Since vectors are here written in boldface font there should be no
confusion.
Note that the norm associated with this inner product is the usual Eucledian length
of a vector.

*Remark 2.* It might be wise to refresh some basic linear algebra by consulting a
textbook.  :ref:`fem:approx:exer:linalg1` and
:ref:`fem:approx:exer:linalg2` suggest specific tasks to regain
familiarity with fundamental operations on inner product vector
spaces.

   single: least squreas method; vectors


The least squares method  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now want to find :math:`c_0` such that it minimizes :math:`||\pmb{e}||`. The algebra
is simplified if we minimize the square of the norm, :math:`||\pmb{e}||^2 = (\pmb{e}, \pmb{e})`.
Define


.. math::
        
        E(c_0) = (\pmb{e},\pmb{e}) = (\pmb{f} - c_0\pmb{\varphi}_0, \pmb{f} - c_0\pmb{\varphi}_0)
        \thinspace .
        

We can rewrite the expressions of the right-hand side to a more
convenient form for further work:


.. math::
   :label: fem:vec:E
        
        E(c_0) = (\pmb{f},\pmb{f}) - 2c_0(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_0) + c_0^2(\pmb{\varphi}_0,\pmb{\varphi}_0)\thinspace .
        
        

The rewrite results from using the following fundamental rules for inner
product spaces:


.. math::
        
        (\alpha\pmb{u},\pmb{v})=\alpha(\pmb{u},\pmb{v}),\quad \alpha\in\mathbb{R},
        



.. math::
        
        (\pmb{u} +\pmb{v},\pmb{w}) = (\pmb{u},\pmb{w}) + (\pmb{v}, \pmb{w}),
        



.. math::
        
        (\pmb{u}, \pmb{v}) = (\pmb{v}, \pmb{u})\thinspace . 


Minimizing :math:`E(c_0)` implies finding :math:`c_0` such that


.. math::
         \frac{\partial E}{\partial c_0} = 0\thinspace . 

Differentiating :eq:`fem:vec:E` with respect to :math:`c_0` gives


.. math::
   :label: fem:vec:dEdc0:v1
        
        \frac{\partial E}{\partial c_0} = -2(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_0) + 2c_0 (\pmb{\varphi}_0,\pmb{\varphi}_0)
        \thinspace .
        
        

Setting the above expression equal to zero and solving for :math:`c_0` gives


.. math::
   :label: fem:vec:c0
        
        c_0 = \frac{(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_0)}{(\pmb{\varphi}_0,\pmb{\varphi}_0)},
        
        

which in the present case with :math:`\pmb{\varphi}_0=(a,b)` results in


.. math::
        
        c_0 = \frac{3a + 5b}{a^2 + b^2}\thinspace . 


For later, it is worth mentioning that setting
the key equation :eq:`fem:vec:dEdc0:v1` to zero can be rewritten
as


.. math::
        
        (\pmb{f}-c0\pmb{\varphi}_0,\pmb{\varphi}_0) = 0,
        

or


.. math::
   :label: fem:vec:dEdc0:Galerkin
        
        (\pmb{e}, \pmb{\varphi}_0) = 0
        \thinspace .
        
        






.. index::
   single: Galerkin method; vectors

.. index::
   single: projection; vectors


The Galerkin or projection method  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minimizing :math:`||\pmb{e}||^2` implies that :math:`\pmb{e}` is
orthogonal to *any* vector :math:`\pmb{v}` in the space :math:`V`. This result is
visually quite clear from Figure :ref:`fem:approx:vec:plane:fig` (think of
other vectors along the line :math:`(a,b)`: all of them will lead to
a larger distance between the approximation and :math:`\pmb{f}`).
To see this result mathematically, we
express any :math:`\pmb{v}\in V` as :math:`\pmb{v}=s\pmb{\varphi}_0` for any scalar parameter :math:`s`,
recall that two vectors are orthogonal when their inner product vanishes,
and calculate the inner product

.. math::
        
        (\pmb{e}, s\pmb{\varphi}_0) &= (\pmb{f} - c_0\pmb{\varphi}_0, s\pmb{\varphi}_0)\\
        &= (\pmb{f},s\pmb{\varphi}_0) - (c_0\pmb{\varphi}_0, s\pmb{\varphi}_0)\\
        &= s(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_0) - sc_0(\pmb{\varphi}_0, \pmb{\varphi}_0)\\
        &= s(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_0) - s\frac{(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_0)}{(\pmb{\varphi}_0,\pmb{\varphi}_0)}(\pmb{\varphi}_0,\pmb{\varphi}_0)\\
        &= s\left( (\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_0) - (\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_0)\right)\\
        &=0\thinspace .
        

Therefore, instead of minimizing the square of the norm, we could
demand that :math:`\pmb{e}` is orthogonal to any vector in :math:`V`.
This approach is known as *projection*, because we it is the same as
projecting the vector onto the subspace.
We may also use the term *Galerkin's method*.
Mathematically the approach is stated
by the equation


.. math::
   :label: fem:vec:Galerkin1
        
        (\pmb{e}, \pmb{v}) = 0,\quad\forall\pmb{v}\in V\thinspace .
        
        

Since an arbitrary :math:`\pmb{v}\in V` can be expressed as
:math:`s\pmb{\varphi}_0`, :math:`s\in\mathbb{R}`,
:eq:`fem:vec:Galerkin1` implies


.. math::
         (\pmb{e},s\pmb{\varphi}_0) = s(\pmb{e}, \pmb{\varphi}_0) = 0,

which means that the error must be orthogonal to the basis vector in
the space :math:`V`:


.. math::
        
        (\pmb{e}, \pmb{\varphi}_0)=0\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
        (\pmb{f} - c_0\pmb{\varphi}_0, \pmb{\varphi}_0)=0
        \thinspace .
        

The latter equation gives :eq:`fem:vec:c0` for :math:`c_0`.
Furthermore, the latter equation also arose
from least squares computations in
:eq:`fem:vec:dEdc0:Galerkin`.




.. _fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:

Approximation of general vectors
--------------------------------

.. index::
   single: approximation; of general vectors



Let us generalize the vector approximation from the previous section
to vectors in spaces with arbitrary dimension. Given some vector :math:`\pmb{f}`,
we want to find the best approximation to this vector in
the space


.. math::
        
        V = \hbox{span}\,\{\pmb{\varphi}_0,\ldots,\pmb{\varphi}_N\}
        \thinspace .
        

We assume that the *basis vectors* :math:`\pmb{\varphi}_0,\ldots,\pmb{\varphi}_N` are
linearly independent so that none of them are redundant and
the space has dimension :math:`N+1`.
Any vector :math:`\pmb{u}\in V` can be written as a linear combination
of the basis vectors,


.. math::
         \pmb{u} = \sum_{j=0}^Nc_j\pmb{\varphi}_j,

where :math:`c_j\in\mathbb{R}` are scalar coefficients to be determined.

The least squares method  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we want to find :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` such that :math:`\pmb{u}` is the best
approximation to :math:`\pmb{f}` in the sense that the distance, or error,
:math:`\pmb{e} = \pmb{f} - \pmb{u}` is minimized. Again, we define
the squared distance as a function of the free parameters
:math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`,


.. math::
   :label: fem:vec:genE
        
        E(c_0,\ldots,c_N) &= (\pmb{e},\pmb{e}) = (\pmb{f} -\sum_jc_j\pmb{\varphi}_j,\pmb{f} -\sum_jc_j\pmb{\varphi}_j)
        \nonumber\\
        &= (\pmb{f},\pmb{f}) - 2\sum_{j=0}^Nc_j(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_j) +
        \sum_{p=0}^N\sum_{q=0}^N c_pc_q(\pmb{\varphi}_p,\pmb{\varphi}_q)\thinspace .
        
        

Minimizing this :math:`E` with respect to the independent variables
:math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` is obtained by setting


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial E}{\partial c_i} = 0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N
        \thinspace .
        

The second term in :eq:`fem:vec:genE` is differentiated as follows:


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial}{\partial c_i}
        \sum_{j=0}^Nc_j(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_j) = (\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_i),
        

since the expression to be differentiated is a sum and only one term,
:math:`c_i(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_i)`,
contains :math:`c_i` and this term is linear in :math:`c_i`.
To understand this differentiation in detail, write out the sum specifically for,
e.g, :math:`N=3` and :math:`i=1`.

The last term in :eq:`fem:vec:genE`
is more tedious to differentiate. We start with


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial}{\partial c_i}
        c_pc_q =
        \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        0, & \hbox{ if } p\neq i\hbox{ and } q\neq i,\\
        c_q, & \hbox{ if } p=i\hbox{ and } q\neq i,\\
        c_p, & \hbox{ if } p\neq i\hbox{ and } q=i,\\
        2c_i, & \hbox{ if } p=q= i,\\
        \end{array}\right.
        

Then


.. math::
         \frac{\partial}{\partial c_i}
        \sum_{p=0}^N\sum_{q=0}^N c_pc_q(\pmb{\varphi}_p,\pmb{\varphi}_q)
        = \sum_{p=0, p\neq i}^N c_p(\pmb{\varphi}_p,\pmb{\varphi}_i)
        + \sum_{q=0, q\neq i}^N c_q(\pmb{\varphi}_q,\pmb{\varphi}_i)
        +2c_i(\pmb{\varphi}_i,\pmb{\varphi}_i)\thinspace . 

The last term can be included in the other two sums, resulting in


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial}{\partial c_i}
        \sum_{p=0}^N\sum_{q=0}^N c_pc_q(\pmb{\varphi}_p,\pmb{\varphi}_q)
        = 2\sum_{j=0}^N c_i(\pmb{\varphi}_j,\pmb{\varphi}_i)\thinspace . 

It then follows that setting


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial E}{\partial c_i} = 0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N,

leads to a linear system
for :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`:


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:eqsys
        
        \sum_{j=0}^N A_{i,j} c_j = b_i, \quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        
        

where


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} &= (\pmb{\varphi}_i,\pmb{\varphi}_j),\\
        b_i &= (\pmb{\varphi}_i, \pmb{f})\thinspace . 

(Note that we can change the order of the two vectors in the inner
product as desired.)

The Galerkin or projection method  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In analogy with the "one-dimensional" example in
the section :ref:`fem:approx:vec:plane`, it holds also here in the general
case that minimizing the distance
(error) :math:`\pmb{e}` is equivalent to demanding that :math:`\pmb{e}` is orthogonal to
all :math:`\pmb{v}\in V`:

.. index::
   single: Galerkin method; vectors

.. index::
   single: projection; vectors



.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin
        
        (\pmb{e},\pmb{v})=0,\quad \forall\pmb{v}\in V\thinspace .
        
        

Since any :math:`\pmb{v}\in V` can be written as :math:`\pmb{v} =\sum_{i=0}^N c_i\pmb{\varphi}_i`,
the statement :eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin` is equivalent to
saying that


.. math::
         (\pmb{e}, \sum_{i=0}^N c_i\pmb{\varphi}_i) = 0,

for any choice of coefficients :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N\in\mathbb{R}`.
The latter equation can be rewritten as


.. math::
         \sum_{i=0}^Nc_i (\pmb{e},\pmb{\varphi}_i) =0\thinspace . 

If this is to hold for arbitrary values of :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`,
we must require that each term in the sum vanishes,


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin0
        
        (\pmb{e},\pmb{\varphi}_i)=0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace .
        
        

These :math:`N+1` equations result in the same linear system as
:eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:eqsys`:


.. math::
         (\pmb{f} - \sum_{j=0}^Nc_j\pmb{\varphi}_j, \pmb{\varphi}_i) = (\pmb{f}, \pmb{\varphi}_i) - \sum_{j=0}^N
        (\pmb{\varphi}_i,\pmb{\varphi}_j)c_j = 0,

and hence


.. math::
         \sum_{j=0}^N (\pmb{\varphi}_i,\pmb{\varphi}_j)c_j = (\pmb{f}, \pmb{\varphi}_i),\quad i=0,\ldots, N
        \thinspace .
        

So, instead of differentiating the
:math:`E(c_0,\ldots,c_N)` function, we could simply use
:eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin` as the principle for
determining :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`, resulting in the :math:`N+1`
equations :eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin0`.

The names *least squares method* or *least squares approximation*
are natural since the calculations consists of
minimizing :math:`||\pmb{e}||^2`, and :math:`||\pmb{e}||^2` is a sum of squares
of differences between the components in :math:`\pmb{f}` and :math:`\pmb{u}`.
We find :math:`\pmb{u}` such that this sum of squares is minimized.

The principle :eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin`,
or the equivalent form :eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin0`,
is known as *projection*. Almost the same mathematical idea
was used by the Russian mathematician `Boris Galerkin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Galerkin>`_ to solve
differential equations, resulting in what is widely known as
*Galerkin's method*.


.. _fem:approx:global:

Approximation of functions
==========================

.. index::
   single: approximation; of functions


Let :math:`V` be a function space spanned by a set of *basis functions*
:math:`{\varphi}_0,\ldots,{\varphi}_N`,


.. math::
         V = \hbox{span}\,\{{\varphi}_0,\ldots,{\varphi}_N\},

such that any function :math:`u\in V` can be written as a linear
combination of the basis functions:


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:ufem
        
        u = \sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j\thinspace .
        
        

For now, in this introduction, we shall look at functions of a
single variable :math:`x`:
:math:`u=u(x)`, :math:`{\varphi}_i={\varphi}_i(x)`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`. Later, we will extend
the scope to functions of two- or three-dimensional physical spaces.
The approximation :eq:`fem:approx:ufem` is typically used
to discretize a problem in space. Other methods, most notably
finite differences, are common for time discretization (although the
form :eq:`fem:approx:ufem` can be used in time too).

.. _fem:approx:LS:

The least squares method  (3)
-----------------------------

Given a function :math:`f(x)`, how can we determine its best approximation
:math:`u(x)\in V`? A natural starting point is to apply the same reasoning
as we did for vectors in the section :ref:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim`. That is,
we minimize the distance between :math:`u` and :math:`f`. However, this requires
a norm for measuring distances, and a norm is most conveniently
defined through an
inner product. Viewing a function as a vector of infinitely
many point values, one for each value of :math:`x`, the inner product could
intuitively be defined as the usual summation of
pairwise components, with summation replaced by integration:


.. math::
        
        (f,g) = \int f(x)g(x)\, dx
        \thinspace .
        

To fix the integration domain, we let :math:`f(x)` and :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)`
be defined for a domain :math:`\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}`.
The inner product of two functions :math:`f(x)` and :math:`g(x)` is then


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:LS:innerprod
        
        (f,g) = \int_\Omega f(x)g(x)\, dx
        
        \thinspace .
        


The distance between :math:`f` and any function :math:`u\in V` is simply
:math:`f-u`, and the squared norm of this distance is


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:LS:E
        
        E = (f(x)-\sum_{j=0}^Nc_j{\varphi}_j(x), f(x)-\sum_{j=0}^Nc_j{\varphi}_j(x))\thinspace .
        
        

Note the analogy with :eq:`fem:vec:genE`: the given function
:math:`f` plays the role of the given vector :math:`\pmb{f}`, and the basis function
:math:`{\varphi}_i` plays the role of the basis vector :math:`\pmb{\varphi}_i`.
We get can rewrite :eq:`fem:approx:LS:E`,
through similar steps as used for the result
:eq:`fem:vec:genE`, leading to


.. math::
        
        E(c_0,\ldots,c_N) = (f,f) -2\sum_{j=0}^N c_j(f,{\varphi}_i)
        + \sum_{p=0}^N\sum_{q=0}^N c_pc_q({\varphi}_p,{\varphi}_q)\thinspace . 

Minimizing this function of :math:`N+1` scalar variables
:math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` requires differentiation
with respect to :math:`c_i`, for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`. The resulting
equations are very similar to those we had in the vector case,
and we hence end up with a
linear system of the form :eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:eqsys`, with


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} &= ({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j),
        \\
        b_i &= (f,{\varphi}_i)\thinspace .
        
        


The Galerkin or projection method  (3)
--------------------------------------


.. index::
   single: Galerkin method; functions

.. index::
   single: projection; functions


As in the section :ref:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim`, the minimization of :math:`(e,e)`
is equivalent to


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:Galerkin
        
        (e,v)=0,\quad\forall v\in V\thinspace .
        
        

This is known as a projection of a function :math:`f` onto the subspace :math:`V`.
We may also call it a Galerkin method for approximating functions.
Using the same reasoning as
in
:eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin`-:eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin0`,
it follows that :eq:`fem:approx:Galerkin` is equivalent to


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:Galerkin0
        
        (e,{\varphi}_i)=0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace .
        
        

Inserting :math:`e=f-u` in this equation and ordering terms, as in the
multi-dimensional vector case, we end up with a linear
system with a coefficient matrix :eq:`fem:approx:Aij` and
right-hand side vector :eq:`fem:approx:bi`.

Whether we work with vectors in the plane, general vectors, or
functions in function spaces, the least squares principle and
the Galerkin or projection method are equivalent.

.. _fem:approx:global:linear:

Example: linear approximation
-----------------------------

Let us apply the theory in the previous section to a simple problem:
given a parabola :math:`f(x)=10(x-1)^2-1` for :math:`x\in\Omega=[1,2]`, find
the best approximation :math:`u(x)` in the space of all linear functions:


.. math::
         V = \hbox{span}\,\{1, x\}\thinspace . 

That is, :math:`{\varphi}_0(x)=1`, :math:`{\varphi}_1(x)=x`, and :math:`N=1`.
We seek


.. math::
         u=c_0{\varphi}_0(x) + c_1{\varphi}_1(x) = c_0 + c_1x,

where
:math:`c_0` and :math:`c_1` are found by solving a :math:`2\times 2` the linear system.
The coefficient matrix has elements


.. math::
        
        A_{0,0} &= ({\varphi}_0,{\varphi}_0) = \int_1^21\cdot 1\, dx = 1,\\
        A_{0,1} &= ({\varphi}_0,{\varphi}_1) = \int_1^2 1\cdot x\, dx = 3/2,\\
        A_{1,0} &= A_{0,1} = 3/2,\\
        A_{1,1} &= ({\varphi}_1,{\varphi}_1) = \int_1^2 x\cdot x\,dx = 7/3\thinspace . 

The corresponding right-hand side is


.. math::
        
        b_1 &= (f,{\varphi}_0) = \int_1^2 (10(x-1)^2 - 1)\cdot 1 \, dx = 7/3,\\
        b_2 &= (f,{\varphi}_1) = \int_1^2 (10(x-1)^2 - 1)\cdot x\, dx = 13/3\thinspace . 

Solving the linear system results in


.. math::
        
        c_0 = -38/3,\quad c_1 = 10,
        

and consequently


.. math::
        
        u(x) = 10x - \frac{38}{3}\thinspace . 

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:linear` displays the
parabola and its best approximation in the space of all linear functions.

.. _fem:approx:global:LS:code:

Implementation of the least squares method
------------------------------------------

The linear system can be computed either symbolically or
numerically (a numerical integration rule is needed in the latter case).
Here is a function for symbolic computation of the linear system,
where :math:`f(x)` is given as a ``sympy`` expression ``f`` (involving
the symbol ``x``), ``phi`` is a list of :math:`{\varphi}_0,\ldots,{\varphi}_N`,
and ``Omega`` is a 2-tuple/list holding the domain :math:`\Omega`:


.. code-block:: python

        import sympy as sm
        
        def least_squares(f, phi, Omega):
            N = len(phi) - 1
            A = sm.zeros((N+1, N+1))
            b = sm.zeros((N+1, 1))
            x = sm.Symbol('x')
            for i in range(N+1):
                for j in range(i, N+1):
                    A[i,j] = sm.integrate(phi[i]*phi[j],
                                          (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                    A[j,i] = A[i,j]
                b[i,0] = sm.integrate(phi[i]*f, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
            c = A.LUsolve(b)
            u = 0
            for i in range(len(phi)):
                u += c[i,0]*phi[i]
            return u

Observe that we exploit the symmetry of the coefficient matrix:
only the upper triangular part is computed. Symbolic integration in
``sympy`` is often time consuming, and (roughly) halving the
work has noticeable effect on the waiting time for the function to
finish execution.

Comparing the given :math:`f(x)` and the approximate :math:`u(x)` visually is
done by the following function, which with the aid of
`sympy`'s ``lambdify`` tool converts a ``sympy``
functional expression to a Python function for numerical
computations:


.. code-block:: python

        def comparison_plot(f, u, Omega, filename='tmp.pdf'):
            x = sm.Symbol('x')
            f = sm.lambdify([x], f, modules="numpy")
            u = sm.lambdify([x], u, modules="numpy")
            resolution = 401  # no of points in plot
            xcoor  = linspace(Omega[0], Omega[1], resolution)
            exact  = f(xcoor)
            approx = u(xcoor)
            plot(xcoor, approx)
            hold('on')
            plot(xcoor, exact)
            legend(['approximation', 'exact'])
            savefig(filename)

The ``modules='numpy'`` argument to ``lambdify`` is important
if there are mathematical functions, such as ``sin`` or ``exp``
in the symbolic expressions in ``f`` or ``u``, and these
mathematical functions are to be used with vector arguments, like
``xcoor`` above.

Both the ``least_squares`` and
``comparison_plot``
are found and coded in the file
`approx1D.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/fem/approx1D.py>`_.
The forthcoming examples on their use appear in
``ex_approx1D.py``.


.. _fem:approx:global:exact:

Perfect approximation
---------------------

Let us use the code above to recompute the problem from
the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:linear` where we want to approximate
a parabola. What happens if we add an element :math:`x^2` to the basis and test what
the best approximation is if :math:`V` is the space of all parabolic functions?
The answer is quickly found by running


.. code-block:: python

        >>> from approx1D import *
        >>> x = sm.Symbol('x')
        >>> f = 10*(x-1)**2-1
        >>> u = least_squares(f=f, phi=[1, x, x**2], Omega=[1, 2])
        >>> print u
        10*x**2 - 20*x + 9
        >>> print sm.expand(f)
        10*x**2 - 20*x + 9


Now, what if we use :math:`\phi_i(x)=x^i` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N=40`?
The output from ``least_squares`` gives :math:`c_i=0` for :math:`i>2`.
In fact, we have a general result that
if :math:`f\in V`, the least squares and Galerkin/projection methods compute
the exact solution :math:`u=f`.

The proof is straightforward: if :math:`f\in V`, :math:`f` can be expanded in
terms of the basis functions, :math:`f=\sum_{j=0}^Nd_j{\varphi}_j`, for
some coefficients :math:`d_0,\ldots,d_N`,
and the right-hand side then has entries


.. math::
         b_i = (f,{\varphi}_i) = \sum_{j=0}^Nd_j({\varphi}_j, {\varphi}_i) = \sum_{j=0}^Nd_jA_{i,j}
        \thinspace . 

The linear system :math:`\sum_jA_{i,j}c_j = b_i`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`, is then


.. math::
         \sum_{j=0}^Nc_jA_{i,j} = \sum_{j=0}^Nd_jA_{i,j},\quad i=0,\ldots,N,

which implies that :math:`c_i=d_i` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`.

.. _fem:approx:global:illconditioning:

Ill-conditioning
----------------

The computational example in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:exact`
applies the ``least_squares`` function which invokes symbolic
methods to calculate and solve the linear system. The correct
solution :math:`c_0=9, c_1=-20, c_2=10, c_i=0` for :math:`i\geq 3` is perfectly
recovered.

Suppose we
convert the matrix and right-hand side to floating-point arrays
and then solve the system using finite-precision arithmetics, which
is what one will (almost) always do in real life. This time we
get astonishing results! Up to about :math:`N=7` we get a solution that
is reasonably close to the exact one. Increasing :math:`N` shows that
seriously wrong coefficients are computed.
Below is a table showing the solution of the linear system arising from
approximating a parabola
by functions on the form :math:`u(x)=\sum_{j=0}^Nc_jx^j`, :math:`N=10`.
Analytically, we know that :math:`c_j=0` for :math:`j>2`, but ill-conditioning
may produce :math:`c_j\neq 0` for :math:`j>2`.

The exact value of :math:`c_j`, :math:`j=0,\ldots,10`, appears in the first
column while the other columns correspond to results obtained
by three different methods:

  * Column 2: The matrix and vector are converted to
    the data structure  ``sympy.mpmath.fp.matrix`` and the
    ``sympy.mpmath.fp.lu_solve`` function is used to solve the system.

  * Column 3: The matrix and vector are converted to
    ``numpy`` arrays with data type ``numpy.float32``
    (single precision floating-point number) and solved by
    the ``numpy.linalg.solve`` function.

  * Column 4: As column 3, but the data type is
    ``numpy.float64`` (double
    precision floating-point number).

We see from the numbers in the table that
double precision performs much better than single precision.
Nevertheless, when plotting all these solutions the curves cannot be
visually distinguished (!). This means that the approximations look
perfect, despite the partially wrong values of the coefficients.

Increasing :math:`N` to 12 makes the numerical solver in ``sympy`` report
abort with the message: "matrix is numerically singular".
A matrix has to be non-singular to be invertible, which is a requirement
when solving a linear system. Already when the matrix is close to
singular, it is *ill-conditioned*, which here implies that
the numerical solution algorithms are sensitive to round-off
errors and may produce (very) inaccurate results.

The reason why the coefficient matrix is nearly singular and
ill-conditioned is that our basis functions :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)=x^i` are
nearly linearly dependent for large :math:`i`.  That is, :math:`x^i` and :math:`x^{i+1}`
are very close for :math:`i` not very small. This phenomenon is
illustrated in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:illconditioning`.
There are 15 lines in this figure, but only half of them are
visually distinguishable.
Almost linearly dependent basis functions give rise to an
ill-conditioned and almost singular matrix.  This fact can be
illustrated by computing the determinant, which is indeed very close
to zero (recall that a zero determinant implies a singular and
non-invertible matrix): :math:`10^{-65}` for :math:`N=10` and :math:`10^{-92}` for
:math:`N=12`. Already for :math:`N=28` the numerical determinant computation
returns a plain zero.

.. figure:: fig-fem/ill_conditioning.png
   :width: 600

   The 15 first basis functions :math:`x^i`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,14`


On the other hand, the double precision ``numpy`` solver do run for
:math:`N=100`, resulting in answers that are not significantly worse than
those in the table above, and large powers are
associated with small coefficients (e.g., :math:`c_j<10^{-2}` for :math:`10\leq
j\leq 20` and :math:`c<10^{-5}` for :math:`j>20`). Even for :math:`N=100` the
approximation lies on top of the exact curve in a plot (!).

The conclusion is that visual inspection of the quality of the approximation
may not uncover fundamental numerical problems with the computations.
However, numerical analysts have studied approximations and ill-conditioning
for decades, and it is well known that the basis :math:`\{1,x,x^2,x^3,\ldots,\}`
is a bad basis. The best basis from a matrix conditioning point of view
is to have orthogonal functions such that :math:`(\phi_i,\phi_j)=0` for
:math:`i\neq j`. There are many known sets of orthogonal polynomials.
The functions used in the finite element methods are almost orthogonal,
and this property helps to avoid problems with solving matrix systems.
Almost orthogonal is helpful, but not enough when it comes to
partial differential equations, and ill-conditioning
of the coefficient matrix is a theme when solving large-scale finite
element systems.

.. _fem:approx:global:Fourier:

.. index::
   single: approximation; by sines


A set of sine functions is widely used for approximating functions.
Let us take


.. math::
        
        V = \hbox{span}\,\{ \sin \pi x, \sin 2\pi x,\ldots,\sin (N+1)\pi x\}
        \thinspace . 

That is,


.. math::
         {\varphi}_i(x) = \sin ((i+1)\pi x),\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace . 

An approximation to the :math:`f(x)` function from
the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:linear` can then be computed by the
``least_squares`` function from the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:LS:code`:


.. code-block:: python

        N = 3
        from sympy import sin, pi
        x = sm.Symbol('x')
        phi = [sin(pi*(i+1)*x) for i in range(N+1)]
        f = 10*(x-1)**2 - 1
        Omega = [0, 1]
        u = least_squares(f, phi, Omega)
        comparison_plot(f, u, Omega)

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine1` (left) shows the oscillatory approximation
of :math:`\sum_{j=0}^{N}c_j\sin ((j+1)\pi x)` when :math:`N=3`.
Changing :math:`N` to 11 improves the approximation considerably, see
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine1` (right).


.. _fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine1:

   :width: 800

   *Best approximation of a parabola by a sum of 3 (left) and 11 (right) sine functions*


There is an error :math:`f(0)-u(0)=9` at :math:`x=0` in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine1` regardless of how large :math:`N` is, because all :math:`{\varphi}_i(0)=0` and hence
:math:`u(0)=0`. We may help the approximation to be correct at :math:`x=0` by
seeking


.. math::
        
        u(x) = f(0) + \sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j(x)
        \thinspace .
        

However, this adjustments introduces a new problem at :math:`x=1` since
we now get an error :math:`f(1)-u(1)=f(1)-0=-1` at this point. A more
clever adjustment is to replace the :math:`f(0)` term by a term that
is :math:`f(0)` at :math:`x=0` and :math:`f(1)` at :math:`x=1`. A simple linear combination
:math:`f(0)(1-x) + xf(1)` does the job:

.. math::
        
        u(x) = f(0)(1-x) + xf(1) + \sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j(x)
        \thinspace .
        

This adjustment of :math:`u` alters the linear system slightly as we get an extra
term :math:`-(f(0)(1-x) + xf(1),{\varphi}_i)` on the right-hand side.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine2` shows the result
of ensuring right boundary values: even 3 sines can now adjust the
:math:`f(0)(1-x) + xf(1)` term such that :math:`u` approximates the parabola really
well, at least visually.

.. _fem:approx:global:orth:

Orthogonal basis functions
--------------------------

The choice of sine functions :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)=\sin ((i+1)\pi x)` has a great
computational advantage: on :math:`\Omega=[0,1]` these basis functions are
*orthogonal*, implying that :math:`A_{i,j}=0` if :math:`i\neq j`. This
result is realized by trying


.. code-block:: python

        integrate(sin(j*pi*x)*sin(k*pi*x), x, 0, 1)

in `WolframAlpha <http://wolframalpha.com>`_
(avoid ``i`` in the integrand as this symbol means
the imaginary unit :math:`\sqrt{-1}`).
Also by asking WolframAlpha
about :math:`\int_0^1\sin^2 (j\pi x) dx`, we find it
to equal 1/2.
With a diagonal matrix we can easily solve for the coefficients
by hand:


.. math::
        
        c_i = 2\int_0^1 f(x)\sin ((i+1)\pi x) dx,\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        

which is nothing but the classical formula for the coefficients of
the Fourier sine series of :math:`f(x)` on :math:`[0,1]`. In fact, when
:math:`V` contains the basic functions used in a Fourier series expansion,
the approximation method derived in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global`
results in the classical Fourier series for :math:`f(x)` (see :ref:`fem:approx:exer:Fourier`
for details).

For orthogonal basis functions we can make the
``least_squares`` function (much) more efficient since we know that
the matrix is diagonal and only the diagonal elements need to be computed:


.. code-block:: python

        def least_squares_orth(f, phi, Omega):
            N = len(phi) - 1
            A = [0]*(N+1)
            b = [0]*(N+1)
            x = sm.Symbol('x')
            for i in range(N+1):
                A[i] = sm.integrate(phi[i]**2, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                b[i] = sm.integrate(phi[i]*f,  (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
            c = [b[i]/A[i] for i in range(len(b))]
            u = 0
            for i in range(len(phi)):
                u += c[i]*phi[i]
            return u

This function is found in the file ``approx1D.py``.

.. _fem:approx:global:interp:

The collocation (interpolation) method
--------------------------------------


.. index:: collocation method (approximation)


.. index::
   single: approximation; collocation


The principle of minimizing the distance between :math:`u` and :math:`f` is
an intuitive way of computing a best approximation :math:`u\in V` to :math:`f`.
However, there are other attractive approaches as well.
One is to demand that :math:`u(x_{i}) = f(x_{i})` at some selected points
:math:`x_{i}`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`:


.. math::
        
        u(x_{i}) = \sum_{j=0}^N c_j {\varphi}_j(x_{i}) = f(x_{i}),\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace . 

This criterion also gives a linear system
with :math:`N+1` unknown coefficients :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`:


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^N A_{i,j}c_j = b_i,\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        

with


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} &= {\varphi}_j(x_{i}),\\
        b_i &= f(x_{i})\thinspace . 

This time the coefficient matrix is not symmetric because
:math:`{\varphi}_j(x_{i})\neq {\varphi}_i(x_{j})` in general.
The method is often referred to as a *collocation method*
and the :math:`x_{i}` points are known as *collocation points*.
Others view the approach as an *interpolation method*
since some point values of :math:`f` are given (:math:`f(x_{i})`) and we
fit a continuous function :math:`u` that goes through the :math:`f(x_{i})` points.
In that case the :math:`x_{i}` points are called *interpolation points*.

``points``, the following Python function sets up and solves the matrix system
for the coefficients :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`:

            A = sm.zeros((N+1, N+1))
            b = sm.zeros((N+1, 1))
            x = sm.Symbol('x')
            # Turn phi and f into Python functions
            phi = [sm.lambdify([x], phi[i]) for i in range(N+1)]
            f = sm.lambdify([x], f)
            for i in range(N+1):
                for j in range(N+1):
                    A[i,j] = phi[j](points[i])
                b[i,0] = f(points[i])
            c = A.LUsolve(b)
            u = 0
            for i in range(len(phi)):
                u += c[i,0]*phi[i](x)
            return u

Note that it is convenient to turn the expressions ``f`` and
``phi`` into Python functions which can be called with
elements of ``points`` as arguments when building the matrix and
the right-hand side.
The ``interpolation`` function is a part of the ``approx1D``
module.

A nice feature of the interpolation or collocation method is that it
avoids computing integrals. However, one has to decide on the location
of the :math:`x_{i}` points.  A simple, yet common choice, is to
distribute them uniformly throughout :math:`\Omega`.

Example  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us illustrate the interpolation or collocation method by approximating
our parabola :math:`f(x)=10(x-1)^2-1` by a linear function on :math:`\Omega=[1,2]`,
using two collocation points :math:`x_0=1+1/3` and :math:`x_1=1+2/3`:


.. code-block:: python

        f = 10*(x-1)**2 - 1
        phi = [1, x]
        Omega = [1, 2]
        points = [1 + sm.Rational(1,3), 1 + sm.Rational(2,3)]
        u = interpolation(f, phi, points)
        comparison_plot(f, u, Omega)

The resulting linear system becomes


.. math::
        
        \left(\begin{array}{ll}
        1 & 4/3\\
        1 & 5/3\\
        \end{array}\right)
        \left(\begin{array}{l}
        c_0\\
        c_1\\
        \end{array}\right)
        =
        \left(\begin{array}{l}
        1/9\\
        31/9\\
        \end{array}\right)
        

with solution :math:`c_0=-119/9` and :math:`c_1=10`.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:linear:interp:fig1` (left) shows the resulting
approximation :math:`u=-119/9 + 10x`.
We can easily test other interpolation points, say :math:`x_0=1` and :math:`x_1=2`.
This changes the line quite significantly, see
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:linear:interp:fig1` (right).

Lagrange polynomials
--------------------

.. index:: Lagrange (interpolating) polynomial


In the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:Fourier` we explain the advantage with having
a diagonal matrix: formulas for the coefficients :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` can
then be derived by hand. For an interpolation/collocation method a
diagonal matrix implies that
:math:`{\varphi}_j(x_{i}) = 0` if :math:`i\neq j`. One set of basis functions :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)`
with this property is the *Lagrange interpolating polynomials*,
or just *Lagrange polynomials*. (Although the functions are named
after Lagrange, they were first discovered by Waring in 1779,
rediscovered by Euler in 1783, and published by Lagrange in 1795.)
The Lagrange polynomials have the form


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:global:Lagrange:poly
        
        {\varphi}_i(x) =
        \prod_{j=0,j\neq i}^N
        \frac{x-x_{j}}{x_{i}-x_{j}}
        = \frac{x-x_0}{x_{i}-x_0}\cdots\frac{x-x_{i-1}}{x_{i}-x_{i-1}}\frac{x-x_{i+1}}{x_{i}-x_{i+1}}
        \cdots\frac{x-x_N}{x_{i}-x_N},
        
        

for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`.
We see from :eq:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:poly` that all the :math:`{\varphi}_i`
functions are polynomials of degree :math:`N` which have the property


.. math::
   :label: fem:inter:prop
        
        {\varphi}_i(x_s) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        1, & i=s,\\
        0, & i\neq s,
        \end{array}\right.
        
        

when :math:`x_s` is an interpolation/collocation point.
This property implies that :math:`A_{i,j}=0` for :math:`i\neq j` and
:math:`A_{i,j}=1` when :math:`i=j`. The solution of the linear system is
them simply


.. math::
        
        c_i = f(x_{i}),\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        

and


.. math::
        
        u(x) = \sum_{j=0}^N f(x_{i}){\varphi}_i(x)\thinspace . 


The following function computes the Lagrange interpolating polynomial
:math:`{\varphi}_i(x)`, given the interpolation points :math:`x_{0},\ldots,x_{N}` in
the list or array ``points``:


.. code-block:: python

        def Lagrange_polynomial(x, i, points):
            p = 1
            for k in range(len(points)):
                if k != i:
                    p *= (x - points[k])/(points[i] - points[k])
            return p

The next function computes a complete basis using equidistant points throughout
:math:`\Omega`:


.. code-block:: python

        def Lagrange_polynomials_01(x, N):
            if isinstance(x, sm.Symbol):
                h = sm.Rational(1, N-1)
            else:
                h = 1.0/(N-1)
            points = [i*h for i in range(N)]
            phi = [Lagrange_polynomial(x, i, points) for i in range(N)]
            return phi, points

When ``x`` is an ``sm.Symbol`` object, we let the
spacing between
the interpolation points, ``h``, be a ``sympy`` rational number
for nice end results in the formulas for :math:`{\varphi}_i`.
The other case, when ``x`` is a plain Python ``float``,
signifies numerical computing, and then we let ``h`` be a floating-point
number.
Observe that the ``Lagrange_polynomial`` function works equally well
in the symbolic and numerical case (think of ``x`` being an
``sm.Symbol`` object or a Python ``float``).
A little interactive session illustrates the difference between symbolic
and numerical computing of the basis functions and points:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> import sympy as sm
        >>> x = sm.Symbol('x')
        >>> phi, points = Lagrange_polynomials_01(x, N=3)
        >>> points
        [0, 1/2, 1]
        >>> phi
        [(1 - x)*(1 - 2*x), 2*x*(2 - 2*x), -x*(1 - 2*x)]
        
        >>> x = 0.5  # numerical computing
        >>> phi, points = Lagrange_polynomials_01(x, N=3, symbolic=True)
        >>> points
        [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
        >>> phi
        [-0.0, 1.0, 0.0]

The Lagrange polynomials are very much used in finite element methods
because of their property :eq:`fem:inter:prop`.

Successful example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trying out the Lagrange polynomial basis for approximating
:math:`f(x)=\sin 2\pi x` on :math:`\Omega =[0,1]` with the least squares
and the interpolation techniques can be done by


.. code-block:: python

        x = sm.Symbol('x')
        f = sm.sin(2*sm.pi*x)
        phi, points = Lagrange_polynomials_01(x, N)
        Omega=[0, 1]
        u = least_squares(f, phi, Omega)
        comparison_plot(f, u, Omega)
        u = interpolation(f, phi, points)
        comparison_plot(f, u, Omega)

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:sine:ls:colloc` shows the results.
There is little difference between the least squares and the interpolation
technique. Increasing :math:`N` gives visually better approximations.

   *Approximation via least squares (left) and interpolation (right) of a sine function by Lagrange interpolating polynomials of degree 4*


Less successful example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next example concerns interpolating :math:`f(x)=|1-2x|` on
:math:`\Omega =[0,1]` using Lagrange polynomials. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:unif:7:14` shows a peculiar effect: the approximation starts to oscillate
more and more as :math:`N` grows. This numerical artifact is not surprising
when looking at the individual Lagrange polynomials: Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:unif:osc` shows two such polynomials of degree 11, and it is clear
that the basis functions oscillate significantly. The reason is simple,
since we force the functions to be 1 at one point and 0 at many other
points. A polynomial of high degree is then forced to oscillate between
these points. The oscillations are particularly severe at the boundary.
The phenomenon is named *Runge's phenomenon* and you can read

.. index:: Runge's phenomenon

a more detailed explanation on Wikipedia.


.. index:: Chebyshev nodes


Remedy for strong oscillations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The oscillations can be reduced by a more clever choice of
interpolation points, called the *Chebyshev nodes*:


.. math::
        
        x_{i} = \frac{1}{2} (a+b) + \frac{1}{2}(b-a)\cos\left( \frac{2i+1}{2(N+1)}pi\right),\quad i=0\ldots,N,
        

on the interval :math:`\Omega = [a,b]`.
Here is a flexible version of the ``Lagrange_polynomials_01`` function above,
valid for any interval :math:`\Omega =[a,b]` and with the possibility to generate
both uniformly distributed points and Chebyshev nodes:


.. code-block:: python

        def Lagrange_polynomials(x, N, Omega, point_distribution='uniform'):
            if point_distribution == 'uniform':
                if isinstance(x, sm.Symbol):
                    h = sm.Rational(Omega[1] - Omega[0], N)
                else:
                    h = (Omega[1] - Omega[0])/float(N)
                points = [Omega[0] + i*h for i in range(N+1)]
            elif point_distribution == 'Chebyshev':
                points = Chebyshev_nodes(Omega[0], Omega[1], N)
            phi = [Lagrange_polynomial(x, i, points) for i in range(N+1)]
            return phi, points
        
        def Chebyshev_nodes(a, b, N):
            from math import cos, pi
            return [0.5*(a+b) + 0.5*(b-a)*cos(float(2*i+1)/(2*(N+1))*pi) \
                    for i in range(N+1)]

All the functions computing Lagrange polynomials listed
above are found in the module file ``Lagrange.py``.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:Cheb:7:14` shows the improvement of
using Chebyshev nodes (compared with Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:unif:7:14`).

Another cure for undesired oscillation of higher-degree interpolating
polynomials is to use lower-degree Lagrange
polynomials on many small patches of the domain, which is the idea
pursued in the finite element method. For instance, linear Lagrange
polynomials on :math:`[0,1/2]` and :math:`[1/2,1]` would yield a perfect
approximation to :math:`f(x)=|1-2x|` on :math:`\Omega = [0,1]`
since :math:`f` is piecewise linear.

Unfortunately, ``sympy`` has problems integrating the :math:`f(x)=|1-2x|`
function times a polynomial. Other choices of :math:`f(x)` can also
make the symbolic integration fail. Therefore, we should extend
the ``least_squares`` function such that it falls back on
numerical integration if the symbolic integration is unsuccessful.
In the latter case, the returned value from `sympy`'s
``integrate`` function is an object of type ``Integral``.
We can test on this type and utilize the ``mpmath`` module in
``sympy`` to perform numerical integration of high precision.
Here is the code:


.. code-block:: python

        def least_squares(f, phi, Omega):
            N = len(phi) - 1
            A = sm.zeros((N+1, N+1))
            b = sm.zeros((N+1, 1))
            x = sm.Symbol('x')
            for i in range(N+1):
                for j in range(i, N+1):
                    integrand = phi[i]*phi[j]
                    I = sm.integrate(integrand, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                    if isinstance(I, sm.Integral):
                        # Could not integrate symbolically, fallback
                        # on numerical integration with mpmath.quad
                        integrand = sm.lambdify([x], integrand)
                        I = sm.mpmath.quad(integrand, [Omega[0], Omega[1]])
                    A[i,j] = A[j,i] = I
                integrand = phi[i]*f
                I = sm.integrate(integrand, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                if isinstance(I, sm.Integral):
                    integrand = sm.lambdify([x], integrand)
                    I = sm.mpmath.quad(integrand, [Omega[0], Omega[1]])
                b[i,0] = I
            c = A.LUsolve(b)
            u = 0
            for i in range(len(phi)):
                u += c[i,0]*phi[i]
            return u

Finite element basis functions
==============================

The specific basis functions exemplified in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global` are in general nonzero on the entire domain
:math:`\Omega`, see Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:u:sin` for an example. We shall
now turn the attention to basis functions that have *compact support*,
meaning that they are nonzero on only a small portion of
:math:`\Omega`. Moreover, we shall restrict the functions to be *piecewise
polynomials*. This means that the domain is split into subdomains and
the function is a polynomial on one or more subdomains, see Figure
:ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:u:fe` for a sketch involving locally defined
hat functions that make :math:`u=\sum_jc_j{\varphi}_j` piecewise linear. At
the boundaries between subdomains one normally forces continuity of
the function only so that when connecting two polynomials from two
subdomains, the derivative usually becomes discontinuous. These type
of basis functions are fundamental in the *finite element method*.

.. _fem:approx:fe:fig:u:fe:

.. figure:: fig-fem/u_example_fe.png
   :width: 600

   *Approximation based on local piecewise linear (hat) functions*


We first introduce the concepts of elements and nodes in a simplistic fashion
as often met in the literature. Later, we shall generalize the concept
of an element, which is a necessary step to treat a wider class of
approximations within the family of finite element methods.
The generalization is also compatible with
the concepts used in the `FEniCS <http://fenicsproject.org>`_ finite
element software.

.. _fem:approx:fe:def:elements:nodes:

Elements and nodes
------------------

Let us divide the interval :math:`\Omega` on which :math:`f` and :math:`u` are defined
into non-overlapping subintervals :math:`\Omega^{(e)}`, :math:`e=0,\ldots,n_e`:


.. math::
        
        \Omega = \Omega^{(0)}\cup \cdots \cup \Omega^{(n_e)}\thinspace . 

We shall for now
refer to :math:`\Omega^{(e)}` as an *element*, having number :math:`e`.
On each element we introduce a set of points called *nodes*.
For now we assume that the nodes are uniformly spaced throughout the
element and that the boundary points of the elements are also nodes.
The nodes are given numbers both within an element and in the global
domain. These are
referred to as *local* and *global* node numbers, respectively.

Nodes and elements uniquely define a *finite element mesh*, which is our
discrete representation of the domain in the computations.
.. index:: finite element mesh

.. index::
   single: mesh; finite elements

A common special case is that of a *uniformly partitioned mesh* where
each element has the same length and the distance between nodes is constant.

Example  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~

On :math:`\Omega =[0,1]` we may introduce two elements,
:math:`\Omega^{(0)}=[0,0.4]` and :math:`\Omega^{(1)}=[0.4,1]`. Furthermore,
let us introduce three nodes
per element, equally spaced within each element.
The three nodes in element number 0 are :math:`x_0=0`, :math:`x_1=0.2`, and :math:`x_2=0.4`.
The local and global node numbers are here equal.
In element number 1, we have the local nodes :math:`x_0=0.4`, :math:`x_1=0.7`, and :math:`x_2=1`
and the corresponding
global nodes :math:`x_2=0.4`, :math:`x_3=0.7`, and :math:`x_4=1`. Note that
the global node :math:`x_2=0.4` is shared by the two elements.

For the purpose of implementation, we introduce two lists or arrays:
``nodes`` for storing the coordinates of the nodes, with the
global node numbers as indices, and ``elements`` for holding
the global node numbers in each element, with the local node numbers
as indices. The ``nodes`` and ``elements`` lists for the sample mesh
above take the form


.. code-block:: python

        nodes = [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7, 1]
        elements = [[0, 1, 2], [2, 3, 4]]

Looking up the coordinate of local node number 2 in element 1
is here done by ``nodes[elements[1][2]]`` (recall that nodes and
elements start their numbering at 0).

The basis functions
-------------------

Construction principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Standard finite element basis functions are now defined as follows.
Let :math:`i` be the global node number corresponding to local node :math:`r`
in element number :math:`e`.

  * If local node number :math:`r` is not on the boundary of the element,
    take :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` to be the Lagrange
    polynomial that is 1 at the local node number :math:`r` and zero
    at all other nodes in the element. On all other elements, :math:`{\varphi}_i=0`.

  * If local node number :math:`r` is on the boundary of the element,
    let :math:`{\varphi}_i` be made up of the Lagrange polynomial that is 1 at this node
    in element number :math:`e` and its neighboring element.
    On all other elements, :math:`{\varphi}_i=0`.

A visual impression of three such basis functions are given in
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2`.
Sometimes we refer to a Lagrange polynomial on an element :math:`e`, which
means the basis function :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` when :math:`x\in\Omega^{(e)}`, and
:math:`{\varphi}_i(x)=0` when :math:`x\notin\Omega^{(e)}`.

.. figure:: fig-fem/phi/mpl_fe_basis_p2_4e_lab.png
   :width: 600

   *Illustration of the piecewise quadratic basis functions associated with nodes in element 1*


Properties of :math:`{\varphi}_i`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The construction of basis functions according to the principles above
lead to two important properties of :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)`. First,


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:phi:prop1
        
        {\varphi}_i(x_{j}) =
        \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        1, & i=j,\\
        0, & i\neq j,
        \end{array}\right.
        
        

when :math:`x_{j}` is a node in the mesh with global node number :math:`j`,
because the Lagrange polynomials are constructed to have this property.
The property also implies a convenient interpretation of :math:`c_i`
as the value of :math:`u` at node :math:`i`:


.. math::
        
        u(x_{i}) = \sum_{j=0}^N c_j {\varphi}_j (x_{i}) =
        c_i {\varphi}_i (x_{i}) = c_i
        \thinspace .
        

Because of this interpretation,
the coefficient :math:`c_i` is by many named :math:`u_i` or :math:`U_i`.

.. 2DO: switch to U_j?


Second,
:math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` is mostly zero throughout the domain:

 * :math:`{\varphi}_i(x) \neq 0` only on those elements that contain global node :math:`i`,

 * :math:`{\varphi}_i(x){\varphi}_j(x) \neq 0` if and only if :math:`i` and :math:`j` are global node
   numbers in the same element.

Since :math:`A_{i,j}` is the integral of
:math:`{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j` it means that
*most of the elements in the coefficient matrix will be zero*.
We will come back to these properties and use
them actively in computations to save memory and CPU time.

We let each element have :math:`d+1` nodes, resulting in local Lagrange
polynomials of degree :math:`d`. It is not a requirement to have the same
:math:`d` value in each element, but for now we will assume so.

Example on quadratic :math:`{\varphi}_i`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2` illustrates how piecewise
quadratic basis functions can look like (:math:`d=2`). We work with the
domain :math:`\Omega = [0,1]` divided into four equal-sized elements, each having
three nodes.
The ``nodes`` and ``elements`` lists in this particular example become


.. code-block:: python

        nodes = [0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, 0.875, 1.0]

   *Illustration of the piecewise quadratic basis functions associated with nodes in element 1*


Let us explain in detail how the basis functions are constructed
according to the principles.
Consider element number 1 in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2`,
:math:`\Omega^{(1)}=[0.25, 0.5]`, with local nodes
0, 1, and 2 corresponding to global nodes 2, 3, and 4.
The coordinates of these nodes are
:math:`0.25`, :math:`0.375`, and :math:`0.5`, respectively.
We define three Lagrange
polynomials on this element:

1. The polynomial that is 1 at local node 1
   (:math:`x=0.375`, global node 3) makes up the basis function
   :math:`{\varphi}_3(x)` over this element,
   with :math:`{\varphi}_3(x)=0` outside the element.

2. The Lagrange polynomial that is 1 at local node 0 is the "right
   part" of the global basis function
   :math:`{\varphi}_2(x)`. The "left part" of :math:`{\varphi}_2(x)` consists of
   a Lagrange polynomial associated with local node 2 in
   the neighboring element :math:`\Omega^{(0)}=[0, 0.25]`.

3. Finally, the polynomial that is 1 at local node 2 (global node 4)
   is the "left part" of the global basis function :math:`{\varphi}_4(x)`.
   The "right part" comes from the Lagrange polynomial that is 1 at
   local node 0 in the neighboring element :math:`\Omega^{(2)}=[0.5, 0.75]`.

As mentioned earlier,
any global basis function :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` is zero on elements that
do not share the node with global node number :math:`i`.

The other global functions associated with internal
nodes, :math:`{\varphi}_1`, :math:`{\varphi}_5`, and :math:`{\varphi}_7`, are all of the
same shape as the drawn :math:`{\varphi}_3`, while the global basis functions
associated with shared nodes also have the same shape, provided the
elements are of the same length.

.. This was difficult to follow:

.. The basis function :math:`{\varphi}_2(x)`, corresponding to a node on the

.. boundary of element 0 and 1, is made up of two pieces: (i) the Lagrange

.. polynomial on element 1 that is 1 at local node 0 (global node 2)

.. and zero at all other nodes in element 1, and (ii)

.. the Lagrange

.. polynomial on element 1 that is 1 at local node 2 (global node 2)

.. and zero at all other nodes in element 0. Outside the elements that

.. share global node 2, :math:`{\varphi}_2(x)=0`. The same reasoning is applied to

.. the construction of :math:`{\varphi}_4(x)` and :math:`{\varphi}_6(x)`.

   *Illustration of the piecewise linear basis functions associated with nodes in element 1*


Example on linear :math:`{\varphi}_i`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P1` shows
piecewise linear basis functions (:math:`d=1`). Also here we have four elements on
:math:`\Omega = [0,1]`. Consider the element :math:`\Omega^{(1)}=[0.25,0.5]`.
Now there are no internal nodes in the elements so that all basis
functions are associated with nodes at the element boundaries and hence
made up of two Lagrange polynomials from neighboring elements.
For example, :math:`{\varphi}_1(x)` results from the Lagrange polynomial in
element 0 that is 1 at local node 1 and 0 at local node 0, combined with
the Lagrange polynomial in
element 1 that is 1 at local node 0 and 0 at local node 1.
The other basis functions are constructed similarly.

Explicit mathematical formulas are needed for :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` in computations.
In the
piecewise linear case, one can show that


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula1
        
        {\varphi}_i(x) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        0, & x < x_{i-1},\\
        (x - x_{i-1})/(x_{i} - x_{i-1}),
        & x_{i-1} \leq x < x_{i},\\
        1 -
        (x - x_{i})/(x_{i+1} - x_{i}),
        & x_{i} \leq x < x_{i+1},\\
        0, & x\geq x_{i+1}\thinspace . \end{array}
        \right.
        
        

Here, :math:`x_{j}`, :math:`j=i-1,i,i+1`, denotes the coordinate of node :math:`j`.
For elements of equal length :math:`h` the formulas can be simplified to


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2
        
        {\varphi}_i(x) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        0, & x < x_{i-1},\\
        (x - x_{i-1})/h,
        & x_{i-1} \leq x < x_{i},\\
        1 -
        (x - x_{i})/h,
        & x_{i} \leq x < x_{i+1},\\
        0, & x\geq x_{i+1}
        \end{array}
        \right.
        
        



Example on cubic :math:`{\varphi}_i`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Piecewise cubic basis functions can be defined by introducing four
nodes per element. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P3` shows
examples on :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)`, :math:`i=3,4,5,6`, associated with element number 1.
Note that :math:`{\varphi}_4` and :math:`{\varphi}_5` are nonzero on element number 1,
while
:math:`{\varphi}_3` and :math:`{\varphi}_6` are made up of Lagrange polynomials on two
neighboring elements.

   *Illustration of the piecewise cubic basis functions associated with nodes in element 1*



.. index:: chapeau function

.. index:: hat function

.. index:: finite element basis function


We see that all the piecewise linear basis functions have the same
"hat" shape. They are naturally referred to as *hat functions*,
also called *chapeau functions*.
The piecewise quadratic functions in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2`
are seen to be of two types. "Rounded hats" associated with internal
nodes in the elements and some more "sombrero" shaped hats associated
with element boundary nodes. Higher-order basis functions also have
hat-like shapes, but the functions have pronounced oscillations in addition,
as illustrated in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P3`.


.. index:: linear elements

.. index:: quadratic elements

.. index:: P1 element

.. index:: P2 element


A common terminology is to speak about *linear elements* as
elements with two local nodes and where the basis functions are
piecewise linear. Similarly, *quadratic elements* and
*cubic elements* refer to piecewise quadratic or cubic functions
over elements with three or four local nodes, respectively.
Alternative names, frequently used later, are P1 elements for linear
elements, P2 for quadratic elements, and so forth (P$d$ signifies
degree :math:`d` of the polynomial basis functions).

.. _fem:approx:global:linearsystem:

Calculating the linear system
-----------------------------

The elements in the coefficient matrix and right-hand side, given
by the formulas :eq:`fem:approx:Aij` and :eq:`fem:approx:bi`,
will now be calculated for piecewise polynomial basis
functions. Consider P1 (piecewise linear) elements. Nodes and elements
numbered consecutively from left to right imply the nodes
:math:`x_i=i h` and the elements


.. math::
        
        \Omega^{(i)} = [x_{i},x_{i+1}] = [i h, (i+1)h],\quad
        i=0,\ldots,N-1
        \thinspace .
        

We have in this case :math:`N` elements and :math:`N+1` nodes,
and :math:`\Omega=[x_{0},x_{N}]`.
The formula for :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` is given by
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2` and a graphical illustration is
provided in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P1`.  First we clearly see
from Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P1` that the important property
:math:`{\varphi}_i(x){\varphi}_j(x)\neq 0` if and only if :math:`j=i-1`, :math:`j=i`, or
:math:`j=i+1`, or alternatively expressed, if and only if :math:`i` and :math:`j` are
nodes in the same element. Otherwise, :math:`{\varphi}_i` and :math:`{\varphi}_j` are
too distant to have an overlap and consequently a nonzero product.

The element :math:`A_{i,i-1}` in the coefficient matrix can be calculated as


.. math::
        
        \int_\Omega {\varphi}_i{\varphi}_{i-1}dx = \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i}}
        \left(1 - \frac{x - x_{i-1}}{h}\right)\frac{x - x_{i}}{h} dx =
        \frac{h}{6}
        \thinspace .
        

It turns out that :math:`A_{i,i+1} =h/6` as well and that
:math:`A_{i,i}=2h/3`. The numbers are modified for :math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N`:
:math:`A_{0,0}=h/3` and :math:`A_{N,N}=h/3`.
The general formula for the right-hand side becomes


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:bi:formula1
        
        b_i = \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i}} \frac{x - x_{i-1}}{h} f(x)dx
        + \int_{x_{i}}^{x_{i+1}} \left(1 - \frac{x - x_{i}}{h}\right) f(x)dx\thinspace .
        
        

With two equal-sized elements in :math:`\Omega=[0,1]` and :math:`f(x)=x(1-x)`, one gets


.. math::
        
        A = \frac{h}{6}\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
        2 & 1 & 0\\
        1 & 4 & 1\\
        0 & 1 & 2
        \end{array}\right),\quad
        b = \frac{h^2}{12}\left(\begin{array}{c}
        2 - 3h\\
        12 - 14h\\
        10 -17h
        \end{array}\right)\thinspace .
        

The solution becomes


.. math::
         c_0 = \frac{h^2}{6},\quad c_1 = h - \frac{5}{6}h^2,\quad
        c_2 = 2h - \frac{23}{6}h^2\thinspace . 

The resulting function


.. math::
         u(x)=c_0{\varphi}_0(x) + c_1{\varphi}_1(x) + c_2{\varphi}_2(x)

is displayed in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:ls:P1:2:4` (left).
Doubling the number of elements to four leads to the improved
approximation in the right part of Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:ls:P1:2:4`.

   *Least squares approximation using 2 (left) and 4 (right) P1 elements*



.. _fem:approx:fe:elementwise:

Assembly of elementwise computations
------------------------------------

The integrals are naturally split into integrals over individual elements
since the formulas change with the elements. This idea of splitting the
integral is fundamental in all practical implementations of the finite
element method.

Let us split the integral over :math:`\Omega` into a sum of contributions from
each element:


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:elementwise:Asplit
        
        A_{i,j} = \int_\Omega{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_jdx = \sum_{e} A^{(e)}_{i,j},\quad
        A^{(e)}_{i,j}=\int_{\Omega^{(e)}} {\varphi}_i{\varphi}_jdx\thinspace .
        
        

Now, :math:`A^{(e)}_{i,j}\neq 0` if and only if :math:`i` and :math:`j` are nodes in element
:math:`e`. Introduce :math:`i=q(e,r)` as the mapping of local node number :math:`r` in element
:math:`e` to the global node number :math:`i`. This is just a short mathematical notation
for the expression ``i=elements[e][r]`` in a program.
Let :math:`r` and :math:`s` be the local node numbers corresponding to the global
node numbers :math:`i=q(e,r)` and
:math:`j=q(e,s)`. With :math:`d` nodes per element, all the nonzero elements
in :math:`A^{(e)}_{i,j}` arise from the integrals involving basis functions with
indices corresponding to the global node numbers in element number :math:`e`:


.. index:: element matrix



.. math::
         \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}{\varphi}_{q(e,r)}{\varphi}_{q(e,s)}dx,\quad r,s=0,\ldots, d\thinspace .
        

These contributions can be collected in a :math:`(d+1)\times (d+1)` matrix known as
the *element matrix*.
We introduce the notation


.. math::
         \tilde A^{(e)} = \{ \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s}\},\quad r,s=0,\ldots,d,

for the element matrix. For the case :math:`d=2` we have

.. math::
        
        \tilde A^{(e)} = \left\lbrack\begin{array}{lllll}
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{0,0} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{0,1} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{0,2}\\
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{1,0} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{1,1} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{1,2}\\
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{2,0} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{2,1} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{2,2}
        \end{array}\right\rbrack
        \thinspace .
        

Given the numbers :math:`\tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s}`,
we should according to :eq:`fem:approx:fe:elementwise:Asplit`
add the contributions to the global coefficient matrix by


.. math::
        
         A_{q(e,r),q(e,s)} := A_{q(e,r),q(e,s)} + \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s},\quad
        r,s=0,\ldots,d\thinspace . 

This process of adding in elementwise contributions to the global matrix
is called *finite element assembly* or simply *assembly*.
.. index:: assembly

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:assembly` illustrates how element matrices
for elements with two nodes are added into the global matrix.
More specifically, the figure shows how the element matrix associated with
elements 2 and 3 assembled, assuming that global nodes are numbered
from left to right in the domain.



.. _fem:approx:fe:fig:assembly:

.. figure:: fig-fem/matrix-assembly.png
   :width: 600

   *Illustration of matrix assembly*


The right-hand side of the linear system is also computed elementwise:


.. math::
        
        b_i = \int_\Omega{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_jdx = \sum_{e} b^{(e)}_{i},\quad
        b^{(e)}_{i}=\int_{\Omega^{(e)}} f(x){\varphi}_i(x)dx\thinspace . 

We observe that
:math:`b_i^{(e)}\neq 0` if and only if global node :math:`i` is a node in element :math:`e`.
With :math:`d` nodes per element we can collect the :math:`d+1` nonzero contributions
:math:`b_i^{(e)}`, for :math:`i=q(e,r)`, :math:`r=0,\ldots,d`, in an *element vector*


.. math::
         \tilde b_r^{(e)}=\{ \tilde b_r^{(e)}\},\quad r=0,\ldots,d\thinspace . 

These contributions are added to the
global right-hand side by an assembly process similar to that for the
element matrices:


.. math::
        
        b_{q(e,r)} := b_{q(e,r)} + \tilde b^{(e)}_{r},\quad
        r,s=0,\ldots,d\thinspace . 



.. _fem:approx:fe:mapping:

Mapping to a reference element
------------------------------


.. index:: affine mapping

.. index::
   single: mapping of reference cells; affine mapping


Instead of computing the integrals


.. math::
         \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s} = \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}{\varphi}_{q(e,r)}(x){\varphi}_{q(e,s)}(x)dx

over some element
:math:`\Omega^{(e)} = [x_L, x_R]`,
it is convenient to map the element domain :math:`[x_L, x_R]`
to a standardized reference element domain :math:`[-1,1]`.
(We have now introduced
:math:`x_L` and :math:`x_R` as the left and right boundary points of an arbitrary element.
With a natural numbering of nodes and elements from left to right
through the domain, :math:`x_L=x_{e}` and :math:`x_R=x_{e+1}`.)
Let :math:`X` be the coordinate
in the reference element. A linear or *affine mapping* from :math:`X` to :math:`x` reads


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:affine:mapping
        
        x = \frac{1}{2} (x_L + x_R) + \frac{1}{2} (x_R - x_L)X\thinspace .
        
        

This relation can alternatively be expressed by

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:affine:mapping2
        
        x = x_m + \frac{1}{2}hX,
        
        

where we have introduced the element midpoint :math:`x_m=(x_L+x_R)/2` and
the element length :math:`h=x_R-x_L`.

Integrating on
the reference element is a matter of just changing the integration
variable from :math:`x` to :math:`X`. Let


.. math::
        
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X) = {\varphi}_{q(e,r)}(x(X))
        

be the basis function associated with local node number :math:`r` in the
reference element. The integral transformation reads


.. math::
        
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s} = \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}{\varphi}_{q(e,r)}(x){\varphi}_{q(e,s)}(x)dx
        = \int_{-1}^1 {\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X){\tilde{\varphi}}_s(X)\frac{dx}{dX}dX\thinspace . 

The stretch factor :math:`dx/dX` between the :math:`x` and :math:`X` coordinates
becomes the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the mapping
between the coordinate systems in 2D and 3D. To obtain a uniform
notation for 1D, 2D, and 3D problems we therefore replace
:math:`dx/dX` by :math:`\det J` already now. In 1D, :math:`\det J = dx/dX = h/2`.
The integration over the reference element is then written as


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:mapping:Ae
        
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s}
        = \int_{-1}^1 {\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X){\tilde{\varphi}}_s(X)\det J\,dX
        
        \thinspace .
        

The corresponding formula for the element vector entries becomes


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:mapping:be
        
        \tilde b^{(e)}_{r} = \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}f(x){\varphi}_{q(e,r)}(x)dx
        = \int_{-1}^1 f(x(X)){\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)\det J\,dX
        
        \thinspace .
        


Since we from now on will work in the reference
element, we need explicit mathematical formulas for the basis
functions :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` in the reference element only, i.e., we only need
to specify formulas for :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)`.
This is a very convenient simplification compared to specifying
piecewise polynomials in the physical domain.

The :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(x)` functions are simply the Lagrange
polynomials defined through the local nodes in the reference element.
For :math:`d=1` and two nodes per element, we have the linear Lagrange
polynomials


.. math::
        
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_0(X) &= \frac{1}{2} (1 - X)
        \\
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_1(X) &= \frac{1}{2} (1 + X)
        
        

Quadratic polynomials, :math:`d=2`, have the formulas


.. math::
        
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_0(X) &= \frac{1}{2} (X-1)X\\
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_1(X) &= 1 - X^2\\
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_2(X) &= \frac{1}{2} (X+1)X
        

In general,


.. math::
        
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_r(x) = \prod_{s=0,s\neq r}^d \frac{X-X_{(s)}}{X_{(r)}-X_{(s)}},
        

where :math:`X_{(0)},\ldots,X_{(d)}` are the coordinates of the local nodes in
the reference element.
These are normally uniformly spaced: :math:`X_{(r)} = -1 + 2r/d`,
:math:`r=0,\ldots,d`.

.. _fem:approx:fe:intg:ref:

Integration over a reference element
------------------------------------

To illustrate the concepts from the previous section in a specific
example, we now
consider calculation of the element matrix and vector for a specific choice of
:math:`d` and :math:`f(x)`. A simple choice is :math:`d=1` and :math:`f(x)=x(1-x)`
on :math:`\Omega =[0,1]`. We have the general expressions
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:mapping:Ae` and :eq:`fem:approx:fe:mapping:be`
for :math:`\tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s}` and :math:`\tilde b^{(e)}_{r}`.
Writing these out for the choices :eq:`fem:approx:fe:mapping:P1:phi0`
and :eq:`fem:approx:fe:mapping:P1:phi1`, and using that :math:`\det J = h/2`,
we get

        \thinspace .

        \tilde b^{(e)}_{0}
        &= \int_{-1}^1 f(x(X)){\tilde{\varphi}}_0(X)\frac{h}{2} dX\nonumber\\
        &= \int_{-1}^1 (x_m + \frac{1}{2} hX)(1-(x_m + \frac{1}{2} hX))
        \frac{1}{2}(1-X)\frac{h}{2} dX \nonumber\\
        &= - \frac{1}{24} h^{3} + \frac{1}{6} h^{2} x_{m} - \frac{1}{12} h^{2} - \frac{1}{2} h x_{m}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} h x_{m}\\

        &= \int_{-1}^1 f(x(X)){\tilde{\varphi}}_1(X)\frac{h}{2} dX\nonumber\\
        &= \int_{-1}^1 (x_m + \frac{1}{2} hX)(1-(x_m + \frac{1}{2} hX))
        \frac{1}{2}(1+X)\frac{h}{2} dX \nonumber\\
        &= - \frac{1}{24} h^{3} - \frac{1}{6} h^{2} x_{m} + \frac{1}{12} h^{2} -
        \frac{1}{2} h x_{m}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} h x_{m}
        \thinspace .
        

In the last two expressions we have used the element midpoint :math:`x_m`.

Integration of lower-degree polynomials above is tedious,
and higher-degree polynomials that very much more algebra, but ``sympy``
may help. For example,

        >>> import sympy as sm
        >>> x, x_m, h, X = sm.symbols('x x_m h X')
        >>> sm.integrate(h/8*(1-X)**2, (X, -1, 1))
        h/3
        >>> sm.integrate(h/8*(1+X)*(1-X), (X, -1, 1))
        h/6
        >>> x = x_m + h/2*X
        >>> b_0 = sm.integrate(h/4*x*(1-x)*(1-X), (X, -1, 1))
        >>> print b_0
        -h**3/24 + h**2*x_m/6 - h**2/12 - h*x_m**2/2 + h*x_m/2

For inclusion of formulas in documents (like the present one), ``sympy`` can print
expressions in LaTeX format:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> print sm.latex(b_0, mode='plain')
        - \frac{1}{24} h^{3} + \frac{1}{6} h^{2} x_{m}
        - \frac{1}{12} h^{2} - \frac{1}{2} h x_{m}^{2}
        + \frac{1}{2} h x_{m}

Implementation  (1)
===================

Based on the experience from the previous example, it makes
sense to write some code to automate the integration process
for any choice of finite element basis functions. In addition,
we can automate the assembly process and linear system
solution. Appropriate
functions for this purpose document all details of all
steps in the finite element computations and can found in the module file
`fe_approx1D.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/fem/fe_approx1D.py>`_. Some of the functions are explained below.

.. _fem:approx:fe:impl:intg:

Integration
-----------

First we need a Python function for
defining :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)` in terms of a Lagrange polynomial
of degree ``d``:


.. code-block:: python

        import sympy as sm
        import numpy as np
        
        def phi_r(r, X, d):
            if isinstance(X, sm.Symbol):
                h = sm.Rational(1, d)  # node spacing
                nodes = [2*i*h - 1 for i in range(d+1)]
            else:
                # assume X is numeric: use floats for nodes
                nodes = np.linspace(-1, 1, d+1)
            return Lagrange_polynomial(X, r, nodes)
        
        def Lagrange_polynomial(x, i, points):
            p = 1
            for k in range(len(points)):
                if k != i:
                    p *= (x - points[k])/(points[i] - points[k])
            return p

Observe how we construct the ``phi_r`` function to be
a symbolic expression for :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)` if ``X`` is a
``Symbol`` object from ``sympy``. Otherwise, we assume that ``X``
is a ``float`` object and compute the corresponding
floating-point value of :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)`. The
``Lagrange_polynomial`` function, copied here
from the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:Fourier`,
works with both symbolic and
numeric ``x`` and ``points`` variables.

The complete basis :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_0(X),\ldots,{\tilde{\varphi}}_d(X)`
on the reference element is constructed by


.. code-block:: python

        def basis(d=1):
            X = sm.Symbol('X')
            phi = [phi_r(r, X, d) for r in range(d+1)]
            return phi

Now we are in a position to write the function for computing
the element matrix:


.. code-block:: python

        def element_matrix(phi, Omega_e, symbolic=True):
            n = len(phi)
            A_e = sm.zeros((n, n))
            X = sm.Symbol('X')
            if symbolic:
                h = sm.Symbol('h')
            else:
                h = Omega_e[1] - Omega_e[0]
            detJ = h/2  # dx/dX
            for r in range(n):
                for s in range(r, n):
                    A_e[r,s] = sm.integrate(phi[r]*phi[s]*detJ, (X, -1, 1))
                    A_e[s,r] = A_e[r,s]
            return A_e

In the symbolic case (``symbolic`` is ``True``),
we introduce the element length as a symbol
``h`` in the computations. Otherwise, the real numerical value
of the element interval ``Omega_e``
is used and the final matrix elements are numbers,
not symbols.
This functionality can be demonstrated:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> from fe_approx1D import *
        >>> phi = basis(d=1)
        >>> phi
        [1/2 - X/2, 1/2 + X/2]
        >>> element_matrix(phi, Omega_e=[0.1, 0.2], symbolic=True)
        [h/3, h/6]
        [h/6, h/3]
        >>> element_matrix(phi, Omega_e=[0.1, 0.2], symbolic=False)
        [0.0333333333333333, 0.0166666666666667]
        [0.0166666666666667, 0.0333333333333333]


The computation of the element vector is done by a similar
procedure:


.. code-block:: python

        def element_vector(f, phi, Omega_e, symbolic=True):
            n = len(phi)
            b_e = sm.zeros((n, 1))
            # Make f a function of X
            X = sm.Symbol('X')
            if symbolic:
                h = sm.Symbol('h')
            else:
                h = Omega_e[1] - Omega_e[0]
            x = (Omega_e[0] + Omega_e[1])/2 + h/2*X  # mapping
            f = f.subs('x', x)  # substitute mapping formula for x
            detJ = h/2  # dx/dX
            for r in range(n):
                b_e[r] = sm.integrate(f*phi[r]*detJ, (X, -1, 1))
            return b_e

Here we need to replace the symbol ``x`` in the expression for ``f``
by the mapping formula such that ``f`` contains the variable ``X``.

The integration in the element matrix function involves only products
of polynomials, which ``sympy`` can easily deal with, but for the
right-hand side ``sympy`` may face difficulties with certain types of
expressions ``f``. The result of the integral is then an ``Integral``
object and not a number as when symbolic integration is successful.
It may therefore be wise to introduce a fallback on numerical
integration. The symbolic integration can also take much time
before an unsuccessful conclusion so we may introduce a parameter
``symbolic`` and set it to ``False`` to avoid symbolic integration:


.. code-block:: python

        def element_vector(f, phi, Omega_e, symbolic=True):
                ...
                if symbolic:
                    I = sm.integrate(f*phi[r]*detJ, (X, -1, 1))
                if not symbolic or isinstance(I, sm.Integral):
                    h = Omega_e[1] - Omega_e[0]  # Ensure h is numerical
                    detJ = h/2
                    integrand = sm.lambdify([X], f*phi[r]*detJ)
                    I = sm.mpmath.quad(integrand, [-1, 1])
                b_e[r] = I
                ...

Successful numerical integration requires that the symbolic
integrand is converted
to a plain Python function (``integrand``) and that
the element length ``h`` is a real number.

.. _fem:approx:fe:impl:linsys:

Linear system assembly and solution
-----------------------------------

The complete algorithm
for computing and assembling the elementwise contributions
takes the following form


.. code-block:: python

        def assemble(nodes, elements, phi, f, symbolic=True):
            n_n, n_e = len(nodes), len(elements)
            if symbolic:
                A = sm.zeros((n_n, n_n))
                b = sm.zeros((n_n, 1))    # note: (n_n, 1) matrix
            else:
                A = np.zeros((n_n, n_n))
                b = np.zeros(n_n)
            for e in range(n_e):
                Omega_e = [nodes[elements[e][0]], nodes[elements[e][-1]]]
        
                A_e = element_matrix(phi, Omega_e, symbolic)
                b_e = element_vector(f, phi, Omega_e, symbolic)
        
                for r in range(len(elements[e])):
                    for s in range(len(elements[e])):
                        A[elements[e][r],elements[e][s]] += A_e[r,s]
                    b[elements[e][r]] += b_e[r]
            return A, b

The ``nodes`` and ``elements`` variables represent the finite
element mesh as explained earlier.

Given the coefficient matrix ``A`` and the right-hand side ``b``,
we can compute the coefficients :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` in the expansion
:math:`u(x)=\sum_jc_j{\varphi}_j` as the solution vector ``c`` of the linear
system:


.. code-block:: python

        if symbolic:
            c = A.LUsolve(b)
        else:
            c = np.linalg.solve(A, b)

When ``A`` and ``b`` are ``sympy`` arrays,
solution procedure implied by ``A.LUsolve`` is symbolic,
otherwise, when ``A`` and ``b`` are ``numpy`` arrays, a standard
numerical solver is called.
The symbolic version is suited for small problems only
(small :math:`N` values) since the calculation time becomes prohibitively large
otherwise. Normally, the symbolic integration will be more time
consuming in small problems than the symbolic solution of the linear system.

.. _fem:approx:fe:impl:ex1:

Example on computing approximations
-----------------------------------

We can exemplify the use of ``assemble`` on the computational
case from the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:linearsystem` with
two P1 elements (linear basis functions) on the domain :math:`\Omega=[0,1]`.
Let us first work with a symbolic element length:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> h, x = sm.symbols('h x')
        >>> nodes = [0, h, 2*h]
        >>> elements = [[0, 1], [1, 2]]
        >>> phi = basis(d=1)
        >>> f = x*(1-x)
        >>> A, b = assemble(nodes, elements, phi, f, symbolic=True)
        >>> A
        [h/3,   h/6,   0]
        [h/6, 2*h/3, h/6]
        [  0,   h/6, h/3]
        >>> b
        [     h**2/6 - h**3/12]
        [      h**2 - 7*h**3/6]
        [5*h**2/6 - 17*h**3/12]
        >>> c = A.LUsolve(b)
        >>> c
        [                           h**2/6]
        [12*(7*h**2/12 - 35*h**3/72)/(7*h)]
        [  7*(4*h**2/7 - 23*h**3/21)/(2*h)]

We may, for comparison, compute the ``c`` vector for an interpolation/collocation
method, taking the nodes as collocation points.
This is carried out by evaluating ``f`` numerically at the nodes:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> fn = sm.lambdify([x], f)
        >>> c = [fn(xc) for xc in nodes]
        >>> c
        [0, h*(1 - h), 2*h*(1 - 2*h)]


The corresponding numerical computations, as done by ``sympy`` and
still based on symbolic integration, goes as follows:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> nodes = [0, 0.5, 1]
        >>> elements = [[0, 1], [1, 2]]
        >>> phi = basis(d=1)
        >>> x = sm.Symbol('x')
        >>> f = x*(1-x)
        >>> A, b = assemble(nodes, elements, phi, f, symbolic=False)
        >>> A
        [ 0.166666666666667, 0.0833333333333333,                  0]
        [0.0833333333333333,  0.333333333333333, 0.0833333333333333]
        [                 0, 0.0833333333333333,  0.166666666666667]
        >>> b
        [          0.03125]
        [0.104166666666667]
        [          0.03125]
        >>> c = A.LUsolve(b)
        >>> c
        [0.0416666666666666]
        [ 0.291666666666667]
        [0.0416666666666666]


The ``fe_approx1D`` module contains functions for generating the
``nodes`` and ``elements`` lists for equal-sized elements with
any number of nodes per element. The coordinates in ``nodes``
can be expressed either through the element length symbol ``h``
or by real numbers. There is also a function


.. code-block:: python

        def approximate(f, symbolic=False, d=1, n_e=4, filename='tmp.pdf'):

which computes a mesh with ``n_e`` elements, basis functions of
degree ``d``, and approximates a given symbolic expression
``f`` by a finite element expansion :math:`u(x) = \sum_jc_j{\varphi}_j(x)`.
When ``symbolic`` is ``False``, :math:`u(x)` can be computed at a (large)
number of points and plotted together with :math:`f(x)`. The construction
of :math:`u` points from the solution vector ``c`` is done
elementwise by evaluating :math:`\sum_rc_r{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)` at a (large)
number of points in each element, and the discrete :math:`(x,u)` values on
each elements are stored in arrays that are finally
concatenated to form global arrays
with the :math:`x` and :math:`u` coordinates for plotting. The details are
found in the ``u_glob`` function in
``fe_approx1D.py``.

.. _fem:approx:fe:A:structure:

The structure of the coefficient matrix
---------------------------------------

Let us first see how the global matrix looks like if we assemble
symbolic element matrices, expressed in terms of ``h``, from
several elements:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> d=1; n_e=8; Omega=[0,1]  # 8 linear elements on [0,1]
        >>> phi = basis(d)
        >>> f = x*(1-x)
        >>> nodes, elements = mesh_symbolic(n_e, d, Omega)
        >>> A, b = assemble(nodes, elements, phi, f, symbolic=True)
        >>> A
        [h/3,   h/6,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,   0]
        [h/6, 2*h/3,   h/6,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,   0]
        [  0,   h/6, 2*h/3,   h/6,     0,     0,     0,     0,   0]
        [  0,     0,   h/6, 2*h/3,   h/6,     0,     0,     0,   0]
        [  0,     0,     0,   h/6, 2*h/3,   h/6,     0,     0,   0]
        [  0,     0,     0,     0,   h/6, 2*h/3,   h/6,     0,   0]
        [  0,     0,     0,     0,     0,   h/6, 2*h/3,   h/6,   0]
        [  0,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,   h/6, 2*h/3, h/6]
        [  0,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,   h/6, h/3]

(The reader is encouraged to assemble the element matrices by hand and verify
this result, as this exercise will give a hands-on understanding of
what the assembly is about.) In general we have a coefficient matrix that is
tridiagonal:



.. math::
        
        A = \frac{h}{6}
        \left(
        \begin{array}{cccccccccc}
        2 & 1 & 0
        &\cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & 0 \\
        1 & 4 & 1 & \ddots &   & &  & &  \vdots \\
        0 & 1 & 4 & 1 &
        \ddots & &  &  & \vdots \\
        \vdots & \ddots &  & \ddots & \ddots & 0 &  & & \vdots \\
        \vdots &  & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & & \vdots \\
        \vdots & &  & 0 & 1 & 4 & 1 & \ddots & \vdots \\
        \vdots & & &  & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots &\ddots  & 0 \\
        \vdots & & & &  &\ddots  & 1  & 4  & 1 \\
        0 &\cdots & \cdots &\cdots & \cdots & \cdots  & 0 & 1 & 2
        \end{array}
        \right)
        



The structure of the right-hand side is more difficult to reveal since
it involves an assembly of elementwise integrals of
:math:`f(x(X)){\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)h/2`, which obviously depend on the
particular choice of :math:`f(x)`.
It is easier to look at the integration in :math:`x` coordinates, which
gives the general formula :eq:`fem:approx:fe:bi:formula1`.
For equal-sized elements of length :math:`h`, we can apply the
Trapezoidal rule at the global node points to arrive at a somewhat more specific
expression than :eq:`fem:approx:fe:bi:formula1`:


.. math::
        
        b_i &= h\left( \frac{1}{2} \phi_i(x_{0})f(x_{0}) +
        \frac{1}{2} \phi_i(x_{N})f(x_{N}) + \sum_{j=1}^{N-1}
        \phi_i(x_{i})f(x_{i})\right)\\
        & =
        \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        \frac{1}{2} hf(x_i),& i=0\hbox{ or }i=N,\\
        h f(x_i), & 1 \leq i \leq N-1
        \end{array}\right.
        

The reason for this simple formula is simply that :math:`\phi_i` is either
0 or 1 at the nodes and 0 at all but one of them.

Going to P2 elements (``d=2``) leads
to the element matrix


.. math::
        
        A^{(e)} = \frac{h}{30}
        \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
        4 & 2 & -1\\
        2 & 16 & 2\\
        -1 & 2 & 4
        \end{array}\right)
        

and the following global assembled matrix from four elements:


.. math::
        
        A = \frac{h}{30}
        \left(
        \begin{array}{ccccccccc}
        4 & 2 & - 1 & 0
          & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
          2 & 16 & 2
          & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\- 1 & 2 &
          8 & 2 & - 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
          0\\0 & 0 & 2 & 16 & 2 & 0 & 0
          & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & - 1 & 2 & 8
          & 2 & - 1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
          2 & 16 & 2 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0
          & 0 & - 1 & 2 & 8 &
          2 & - 1\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
          2 & 16 & 2\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
          & 0 & - 1 & 2 & 4
        \end{array}
        \right)
        

In general, for :math:`i` odd we have the nonzeroes


.. math::
         A_{i,i-2} = -1,\quad A_{i-1,i}=2,\quad A_{i,i} = 8,\quad A_{i+1,i}=2,
        \quad A_{i+2,i}=-1,

multiplied by :math:`h/30`, and for :math:`i` even we have the nonzeros


.. math::
         A_{i-1,i}=2,\quad A_{i,i} = 16,\quad A_{i+1,i}=2,

multiplied by :math:`h/30`. The rows with odd numbers correspond to
nodes at the element boundaries and get contributions from two
neighboring elements in the assembly process,
while the even numbered rows correspond to
internal nodes in the elements where the only one element contributes
to the values in the global matrix.

Applications

With the aid of the ``approximate`` function in the ``fe_approx1D``
module we can easily investigate the quality of various finite element
approximations to some given functions. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:x9:sin`
shows how linear and quadratic elements approximates the polynomial
:math:`f(x)=x(1-x)^8` on :math:`\Omega =[0,1]`, using equal-sized elements.
The results arise from the program


.. code-block:: python

        import sympy as sm
        from fe_approx1D import approximate
        x = sm.Symbol('x')
        
        approximate(f=x*(1-x)**8, symbolic=False, d=1, n_e=4)
        approximate(f=x*(1-x)**8, symbolic=False, d=2, n_e=2)
        approximate(f=x*(1-x)**8, symbolic=False, d=1, n_e=8)
        approximate(f=x*(1-x)**8, symbolic=False, d=2, n_e=4)

The quadratic functions are seen to be better than the linear ones for the same
value of :math:`N`, as we increase :math:`N`. This observation has some generality:
higher degree is not necessarily better on a coarse mesh, but it is as
we refined the mesh.

Sparse matrix storage and solution
----------------------------------


.. index:: sparse matrices


Some of the examples in the preceding section took several minutes to
compute, even on small meshes consisting of up to eight elements.
The main explanation for slow computations is unsuccessful
symbolic integration: ``sympy`` may use a lot of energy on
integrals like :math:`\int f(x(X)){\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)h/2 dx` before
giving up, and the program resorts to numerical integration.
Codes that can deal with a large number of basis functions and
accept flexible choices of :math:`f(x)` should compute all integrals
numerically and replace the matrix objects from ``sympy`` by
the far more efficient array objects from ``numpy``.

A matrix whose majority of entries are zeros, are known as a *sparse*
matrix. We know beforehand that matrices from finite element
approximations are sparse.  The sparsity should be utilized in
software as it dramatically decreases the storage demands and the
CPU-time needed to compute the solution of the linear system. This
optimization is not critical in 1D problems where modern computers can
afford computing with all the zeros in the complete square matrix, but
in 2D and especially in 3D, sparse matrices are fundamental for
feasible finite element computations.

For one-dimensional finite element approximation problems, using a
numbering of nodes and elements from left to right over the domain,
the assembled coefficient matrix has only a few diagonals different
from zero. More precisely, :math:`2d+1` diagonals are different from
zero. With a different numbering of global nodes, say a random
ordering, the diagonal structure is lost, but the number of
nonzero elements is unaltered. Figures :ref:`fem:approx:fe:sparsity:P1`
and :ref:`fem:approx:fe:sparsity:P3` exemplifies sparsity patterns.

Comparison of finite element and finite difference approximation
================================================================

The previous sections on approximating :math:`f` by a finite element function :math:`u`
utilize the projection/Galerkin or
least squares approaches to minimize the approximation
error. We may, alternatively, use the collocation/interpolation method.
Here we shall compare these three approaches with what one does in
the finite difference method when representing a given function on a mesh.

.. _fem:approx:fe:fd:colloc:

Collocation or interpolation
----------------------------

Let :math:`x_{i}`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`, be the nodes in the mesh.
Collocation means


.. math::
        
        u(x_{i})=f(x_{i}),\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        

which translates to


.. math::
         \sum_{j=0}^N c_j {\varphi}_j(x_{i}) = f(x_{i}),

but :math:`{\varphi}_j(x_{i})=0` if :math:`i\neq j` so the sum collapses to one
term :math:`c_i{\varphi}_i(x_{i}) = c_i`, and we have the result


.. math::
        
        c_i = f(x_{i})
        \thinspace .
        

That is, :math:`u` *interpolates* :math:`f` at the node points (the values coincide
at these points, but the variation between the points is dictated by
the type of polynomials used in the expansion for :math:`u`).
The collocation/interpolation approach is obviously much simpler and
faster to use than the least squares  or projection/Galerkin approach.

*Remark.* When dealing with approximation of functions via finite elements,
all the three methods are in use, while the least squares and collocation
methods are used to only a small extend when solving differential equations.

.. _fem:approx:fe:fd:fdproj:

Finite difference approximation of given functions
--------------------------------------------------

Approximating a given function :math:`f(x)` on a mesh in a finite difference
context will typically just sample :math:`f` at the grid points. That is,
the discrete version of :math:`f(x)` is the set of point values
:math:`f(x_i)`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`, where :math:`x_i` denotes a mesh point.
The collocation/interpolation method above gives exactly the same
representation.

How does a finite element Galerkin or least squares approximation differ
from this straightforward interpolation of :math:`f`? This is the question
to be addressed next.

.. _fem:approx:fe:fd:feproj:

Finite difference interpretation of a finite element approximation
------------------------------------------------------------------

We now limit the scope to P1 elements since this is the element type
that gives formulas closest to what one gets from the finite difference
method.

The linear system arising from a Galerkin or least squares approximation
reads


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^N c_j ({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j) = (f,{\varphi}_i),\quad i=0,\ldots,N
        \thinspace .
        

For P1 elements and a uniform mesh of element length :math:`h`
we have calculated the matrix with entries
:math:`({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j)` in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:linearsystem`.
Equation number :math:`i` reads


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:approx:deq:massmat:diffeq2
        
        \frac{h}{6}(u_{i-1} + 4u_i + u_{i+1}) = (f,{\varphi}_i)
        \thinspace .
        
        

The finite difference counterpart of this equation is just :math:`u_i=f_i`.
(The first and last equation, corresponding to :math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N` are slightly
different, see the section :ref:`fem:approx:fe:A:structure`.)

The left-hand side of :eq:`fem:deq:1D:approx:deq:massmat:diffeq2` can
be manipulated to equal


.. math::
        
        h(u_i - \frac{1}{6}(-u_{i-1} + 2u_i - u_{i+1}))
        \thinspace .
        

Thinking in terms of finite differences, this
is nothing but the standard discretization of


.. math::
         h(u - \frac{h^2}{6}u''),

or written as


.. math::
         [h(u - \frac{h^2}{6}D_x D_x u)]_i,

with difference operators.

Before interpreting the approximation procedure as solving a
differential equation, we need to work out what the right-hand side is
in the context of P1 elements.
Since :math:`{\varphi}_i` is the linear function that is 1 at
:math:`x_{i}` and zero at all other nodes, only the interval :math:`[x_{i-1},x_{i+1}]`
contributes to the integral on the right-hand side. This integral is
naturally split into two parts according to
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2`:


.. math::
         (f,{\varphi}_i) = \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i}} f(x)\frac{1}{h} (x - x_{i-1}) dx
        + \int_{x_{i}}^{x_{i+1}} f(x)\frac{1}{h}(1 - (x - x_{i})) dx
        \thinspace .
        

However, if :math:`f` is not known we cannot do much else with this expression.
It is clear that many values of
:math:`f` around :math:`x_{i}` contributes to the right-hand side, not just
the single point value :math:`f(x_{i})`
as in the finite difference method.

To proceed with the right-hand side, we turn to numerical integration schemes.
Let us say we use the Trapezoidal method for :math:`(f,{\varphi}_i)`, based on
the node points :math:`x_{i}=i h`:


.. math::
         (f,{\varphi}_i) = \int_\Omega f{\varphi}_i dx\approx h\frac{1}{2}(
        f(x_{0}){\varphi}_i(x_{0}) + f(x_{N}){\varphi}_i(x_{N}))
        + h\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} f(x_{j}){\varphi}_i(x_{j})
        \thinspace .
        

Since :math:`{\varphi}_i` is zero at all these points, except at :math:`x_{i}`, the
Trapezoidal rule collapses to one term:


.. math::
        
        (f,{\varphi}_i) \approx hf(x_{i}),
        

for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N-1`,
which is the same result as with collocation/interpolation, and of course
the same result as in the finite difference method.
For :math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N` we get contribution from only one element so


.. math::
        
        (f,{\varphi}_i) \approx \frac{1}{2}hf(x_{i}),\quad i=0,\ i=N
        \thinspace .
        


Turning to Simpson's rule with sample points also in the middle of
the elements, :math:`x_i=i h/2`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,2N`, it reads in general


.. math::
         \int_\Omega f(x)dx \approx \frac{\tilde h}{3}\left( f(x_0) +
        2\sum_{j=2,4,6,\ldots} f(x_j)
        + 4\sum_{j=1,3,5,\ldots} f(x_j) + f(x_{2N})\right),
        

where :math:`\tilde h = x_i - x_{i-1}= h/2` is the spacing between the sample points.
We see that the midpoints with odd numbers have
the weight :math:`2h/3` while the node points with even numbers have the
weight :math:`h/3`. Since :math:`{\varphi}_i=0` at the even numbers, except
for :math:`x_{2i}=x_{i}`, and :math:`{\varphi}_i=0` at all the midpoints,
on the midpoints and :math:`4h/3` on the node points. Since :math:`{\varphi}_i`
vanishes at all the node points, except :math:`\xi{i}`, and
except :math:`x_{2i-1}=\xi{i}-h/2` and
:math:`x_{2i+1}=\xi{i}+h/2`, where :math:`{\varphi}_i=1/2`, we get


.. math::
        
        (f,{\varphi}_i) \approx \frac{h}{3}(f(x_{i}-\frac{1}{2}h)
        + f(x_{i}) + f(x_{i}+\frac{1}{2}h)
        \thinspace .
        

In a finite difference context we would typically express this formula as


.. math::
         \frac{h}{3}(f_{i-\frac{1}{2}} + f_i + f_{i+\frac{1}{2}})
        \thinspace .
        

This shows that, with Simpson's rule, the finite element method
operates with the average of :math:`f` over three points, while the finite difference
method just applies :math:`f` at one point. We may interpret this as
a "smearing" or smoothing of :math:`f` by the finite element method.

We can now summarize our findings. With the approximation of
:math:`(f,{\varphi}_i)` by the Trapezoidal rule, P1 elements give rise
to equations that can be expressed as a finite difference
discretization of


.. math::
        
        u + \frac{h^2}{6} u'' = f,\quad u'(0)=u'(L)=0,
        

expressed with operator notation as


.. math::
        
        [u + \frac{h^2}{6} D_x D_x u = f]_i\thinspace . 

As :math:`h\rightarrow 0`, the extra term proportional to :math:`u''` goes to zero,
and the two methods are then equal.

With the Simpson's rule, we may say that we solve


.. math::
        
        [u + \frac{h^2}{6} D_x D_x u = \bar f]_i,
        

where :math:`\bar f_i` means the average :math:`\frac{1}{3}(f_{i-1/2} + f_i + f_{i+1/2})`.

The extra term :math:`\frac{h^2}{6} u''` represents a smoothing: with just this
term, we would find u by integrating :math:`f` twice and thereby smooth :math:`f`
considerably. In addition, the finite element representation of :math:`f`
involves an average, or a smoothing, of :math:`f` on the right-hand side of
the equation system. If :math:`f` is a noisy function, direct interpolation
:math:`u_i=f_i` may result in a noisy :math:`u` too, but with a Galerkin or least
squares formulation and P1 elements, we should expect that :math:`u` is
smoother than :math:`f` unless :math:`h` is very small.

The interpretation that finite elements tend to smooth the solution
is valid in applications far beyond approximation of 1D function.

Making finite elements behave as finite differences
---------------------------------------------------

With a simple trick, using numerical integration, we can easily produce
the same result :math:`u_i=f_i` with the Galerkin or least square formulation
with P1 elements. This is useful in many occasions when we deal
with more difficult differential equations and want the finite element
method to have properties like the finite difference method (solving
standard linear wave equations is one primary example).

We have already seen that applying the Trapezoidal rule to the
right-hand side :math:`(f,{\varphi}_i)` simply gives :math:`f` sampled at :math:`x_{i}`.
Using the Trapezoidal rule on the  matrix entries
:math:`({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j)` involves a sum

.. math::
         \sum_k {\varphi}_i(x_{k}){\varphi}_j(x_{k}),

but :math:`{\varphi}_i(x_{k})=0` for all :math:`k`, except :math:`k=i`, and
:math:`{\varphi}_j(x_{k})=0` for all :math:`k`, except :math:`k=j`.
The product :math:`{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j` is then different from zero only
when sampled at :math:`x_{i}` and :math:`i=j`. The approximation to the integral
is then


.. math::
         ({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j) \approx h,\quad i=j,

and zero if :math:`i\neq j`. This means that we have obtained a diagonal matrix!
The first and last diagonal elements, :math:`({\varphi}_0,{\varphi}_0)` and
:math:`({\varphi}_N,{\varphi}_N)` get contribution only from the first and last
element, respectively, resulting in the approximate integral value :math:`h/2`.
The corresponding right-hand side also has a factor :math:`1/2` for :math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N`.
Therefore, the least squares or Galerkin approach with P1 elements and
*Trapezoidal* integration results in


.. math::
         c_i = f_i\thinspace . 


Simpsons's rule can be used to achieve a similar result for P2 elements, i.e,
a diagonal coefficient matrix, but with the previously derived
average of :math:`f` on the right-hand side.

Elementwise computations  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Identical results to those above will arise if we perform elementwise
computations. The idea is to use the Trapezoidal rule on the reference
element for computing the element matrix and vector. When assembled,
the same equations :math:`c_i=f(x_{i})` arise. :ref:`fem:approx:fe:exer:1D:trapez` encourages you to carry out the
details.

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

The matrix with entries :math:`({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j)` typically arises
from terms proportional to :math:`u` in a differential equation where :math:`u`
is the unknown function. This matrix is often called the *mass matrix*,
because in the early days of the finite element method, the matrix
arose from the mass times acceleration term in Newton's second law of
motion. Making the mass matrix diagonal by, e.g., numerical integration,
as demonstrated above, is a widely used technique and is called
*mass lumping*. In time-dependent problems it can enhance the numerical
accuracy and computational efficiency of the finite element method.
However, there are also examples where mass lumping destroys accuracy.

A generalized element concept
=============================


So far, finite element computing has employed the ``nodes`` and
``element`` lists together with the definition of the basis functions
in the reference element. Suppose we want to introduce a piecewise
constant approximation with one basis function :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_0(x)=1` in
the reference element. Although we could associate the function value
with a node in the middle of the elements, there are no nodes at the
ends, and the previous code snippets will not work because we
cannot find the element boundaries from the ``nodes`` list.

.. _fem:approx:fe:element:terminology:

Cells, vertices, and degrees of freedom
---------------------------------------


.. index:: cell

.. index:: vertex

.. index:: degree of freedom

.. index:: reference cell


We now introduce *cells* as the subdomains :math:`\Omega^{(e)}` previously
referred as elements. The cell boundaries are denoted as *vertices*.
The reason for this name is that cells are recognized by their vertices
in 2D and 3D. Then we define a set of *degrees of freedom*, which are
the quantities we aim to compute. The most common type of degree
of freedom is the value of the unknown function :math:`u` at some point.
For example, we can introduce nodes as before and say the degrees of
freedom are the values of :math:`u` at the nodes. The basis functions are
constructed so that they equal unity for one particular degree of
freedom and zero for the rest. This property ensures that when
we evaluate :math:`u=\sum_j c_j{\varphi}_j` for degree of freedom number :math:`i`,
we get :math:`u=c_i`. Integrals are performed over cells, usually by
mapping the cell of interest to a *reference cell*.

With the concepts of cells, vertices, and degrees of freedom we increase
the decoupling the geometry (cell, vertices) from the space of
basis functions. We can associate different sets of basis functions
with a cell. In 1D, all cells are intervals, while in 2D we can have
cells that are triangles with straight sides, or any polygon, or in fact
any two-dimensional geometry. Triangles and quadrilaterals are most
common, though. The popular cell types in 3D are tetrahedra and hexahedra.

.. _fem:approx:fe:element:def:

Extended finite element concept
-------------------------------


.. index::
   single: finite element, definition


The concept of a *finite element* is now

  * a *reference cell* in a local reference coordinate system;

  * a set of *basis functions* :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_i` defined on the cell;

  * a set of *degrees of freedom* that uniquely determine
    the basis functions such that :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_i=1` for degree of freedom
    number :math:`i` and :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_i=0` for all other degrees of freedom;

  * a mapping between local and global degree of freedom numbers;

  * a *mapping* of the reference cell onto to cell in the physical
    domain.

There must be a geometric description of a cell. This is trivial in 1D
since the cell is an interval and is described by the interval limits,
here called vertices. If the cell is :math:`\Omega^{(e)}=[x_L,x_R]`,
vertex 0 is :math:`x_L` and vertex 1 is :math:`x_R`. The reference cell in 1D
is :math:`[-1,1]` in the reference coordinate system :math:`X`.

Our previous P1, P2, etc., elements are defined by introducing :math:`d+1`
equally spaced nodes in the reference cell and saying that the degrees
of freedom are the :math:`d+1` function values at these nodes.  The basis
functions must be 1 at one node and 0 at the others, and the Lagrange
polynomials have exactly this property.  The nodes can be numbered
from left to right with associated degrees of freedom that are
numbered in the same way.  The degree of freedom mapping becomes what
was previously represented by the ``elements`` lists.  The cell mapping
is the same affine mapping :eq:`fem:approx:fe:affine:mapping` as
before.


.. index::
   single: finite element expansion; reference element


The expansion of :math:`u` over one cell is often used. In terms of reference
coordinates we have


.. math::
        
        u(x) = \sum_{r} c_r{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X),
        

where the sum is taken over the numbers of the degrees of freedom and
:math:`c_r` is the value of :math:`u` for degree of freedom number :math:`r`.


.. _fem:approx:fe:element:impl:

Implementation  (2)
-------------------


.. index:: cells list

.. index:: vertices list

.. index:: dof_map list


Implementationwise,

  * we replace ``nodes`` by ``vertices``;

  * we introduce ``cells`` such that ``cell[e][r]`` gives the mapping
    from local vertex ``r`` in cell ``e`` to the global vertex number
    in ``vertices``;

  * we replace ``elements`` by ``dof_map`` (the contents are the same).

Consider the example from the section :ref:`fem:approx:fe:def:elements:nodes`
where :math:`\Omega =[0,1]` is divided into two cells,
:math:`\Omega^{(0)}=[0,0.4]` and :math:`\Omega^{(1)}=[0.4,1]`.
The vertices are :math:`[0,0.4,1]`. Local vertex 0 and 1 are
:math:`0` and :math:`0.4` in cell 0 and :math:`0.4` and :math:`1` in cell 1.
A P2 element means that the degrees of freedom are
the value of :math:`u` at three equally spaced points (nodes) in each
cell. The data structures become


.. code-block:: python

        vertices = [0, 0.4, 1]
        cells = [[0, 1], [1, 2]]
        dof_map = [[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]


If we would approximate :math:`f` by piecewise constants, we simply
introduce one point or node in an element, preferably :math:`X=0`,
and choose :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_0(X)=1`. Only the ``dof_map`` is altered:


.. code-block:: python

        dof_map = [[0], [1], [2]]


We use the ``cells`` and ``vertices`` lists to retrieve information
on the geometry of a cell, while ``dof_map`` is used in the
assembly of element matrices and vectors.
For example, the ``Omega_e`` variable (representing the cell interval)
in previous code snippets must now be computed as


.. code-block:: python

        Omega_e = [vertices[cells[e][0], vertices[cells[e][1]]

The assembly is done by


.. code-block:: python

        A[dof_map[e][r], dof_map[e][s]] += A_e[r,s]
        b[dof_map[e][r]] += b_e[r]


We will hereafter work with ``cells``, ``vertices``, and ``dof_map``.

.. fe_approx1D_numint.py can be reworked to dof_map

.. augment with P0


Cubic Hermite polynomials
-------------------------

The finite elements considered so far represent :math:`u` as piecewise
polynomials with discontinuous derivatives at the cell boundaries.
Sometimes it is desired to have continuous derivatives. A primary
examples is the solution of differential equations with fourth-order
derivatives where standard finite element formulations lead to
a need for basis functions with continuous first-order derivatives.
The most common type of such basis functions in 1D is the
cubic Hermite polynomials.

There are ready-made formulas for the cubic Hermite polynomials, but
it is instructive to apply the principles for constructing basis
functions in detail.
Given a reference cell :math:`[-1,1]`, we seek cubic polynomials
with the values of the *function* and its *first-order derivative* at
:math:`X=-1` and :math:`X=1` as the four degrees of freedom. Let us number
the degrees of freedom as

  * 0: value of function at :math:`X=-1`

  * 1: value of first derivative at :math:`X=-1`

  * 2: value of function at :math:`X=1`

  * 3: value of first derivative at :math:`X=1`

By having the derivatives as unknowns, we ensure that
the derivative of a basis function in two neighboring elements
is the same at the node points.

The four basis functions can be written in a general form

.. math::
         {\tilde{\varphi}}_i (X) = \sum_{j=0}^3 C_{i,j}X^j, 

with four coefficients :math:`C_{i,j}`, :math:`j=0,1,2,3`, to be determined for
each :math:`i`. The constraints
that basis function number :math:`i` must be 1 for degree of
freedom number :math:`i` and zero for the other three degrees of freedom,
gives four equations to determine :math:`C_{i,j}` for each :math:`i`. In mathematical
detail,

.. math::
        
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_0 (-1) &= 1,\quad {\tilde{\varphi}}_0 (1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_0'(-1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_i' (1)=0,\\
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_1' (-1) &= 1,\quad {\tilde{\varphi}}_1 (-1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_1(1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_1' (1)=0,\\
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_2 (1) &= 1,\quad {\tilde{\varphi}}_2 (-1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_2'(-1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_2' (1)=0,\\
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_3' (1) &= 1,\quad {\tilde{\varphi}}_3 (-1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_3'(-1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_3 (1)=0
        \thinspace .
        

These four :math:`4\times 4` linear equations can be solved, yielding these formulas
for the cubic basis functions:


.. math::
        
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_0(X) &= 1 - \frac{3}{4}(X+1)^2 + \frac{1}{4}(X+1)^3\\
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_1(X) &= -(X+1)(1 - \frac{1}{2}(X+1))^2\\
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_2(X) &= \frac{3}{4}(X+1)^2 - \frac{1}{2}(X+1)^3\\
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_3(X) &= -\frac{1}{2}(X+1)(\frac{1}{2}(X+1)^2 - (X+1))\\

Numerical integration  (1)
==========================

Finite element codes usually apply numerical approximations to
integrals. Since the integrands in the coefficient matrix often
are (lower-order) polynomials, integration rules that can
integrate polynomials exactly are popular.

The numerical integration rules can be expressed in a common form,


.. math::
        
        \int_{-1}^{1} g(X)dX \approx \sum_{j=0}^M w_j\bar X_j,
        

where :math:`\bar X_j` are *integration points* and :math:`w_j` are
*integration weights*, :math:`j=0,\ldots,M`.
Different rules correspond to different choices of points and weights.

The very simplest method is the *Midpoint rule*,

.. math::
        
        \int_{-1}^{1} g(X)dX \approx 2g(0),\quad \bar X_0=0,\ w_0=2,
        

which integrates linear functions exactly.

The `Newton-Cotes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas>`_
rules are based on a fixed uniform distribution of the points.
The first two formulas in this family is the well-known
*Trapezoidal rule*,


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:numint1:trapez
        
        \int_{-1}^{1} g(X)dX \approx g(-1) + g(1),\quad \bar X_0=-1,\ \bar X_1=1,\ w_0=w_1=1,
         
        

and *Simpson's rule*,


.. math::
        
        \int_{-1}^{1} g(X)dX \approx \frac{1}{3}\left(g(-1) + 4g(0)
        + g(1)\right),
        

where


.. math::
        
        \bar X_0=-1,\ \bar X_1=0,\ \bar X_2=1,\ w_0=w_2=\frac{1}{3},\ w_1=\frac{4}{3}\thinspace . 


Newton-Cotes rules up to five points is supported in the
module file `numint.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/fem/numint.py>`_.

For higher accuracy one can divide the reference cell into a set of
subintervals and use the rules above on each subinterval. This approach
results in *composite* rules, well-known from basic introductions
to numerical integration of :math:`\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx`.

Gauss-Legendre rules with optimized points
------------------------------------------


.. index:: Gauss-Legendre quadrature


All these rules apply equally spaced points. More accurate rules, for
a given :math:`M`, arise if the location of the points are optimized for
polynomial integrands.  The `Gauss-Legendre rules <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature>`_ (also known as
Gauss-Legendre quadrature or Gaussian quadrature) constitute one such
class of integration methods. Two widely applied Gauss-Legendre rules
in this family have the choice


.. math::
        
        M=1&:\quad \bar X_0=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}},\
        \bar X_1=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}},\ w_0=w_1=1\\
        M=2&:\quad \bar X_0=-\sqrt{\frac{3}{{5}}},\ \bar X_0=0,\
        \bar X_2= \sqrt{\frac{3}{{5}}},\ w_0=w_2=\frac{5}{9},\ w_1=\frac{8}{9}\thinspace . 

These rules integrate 3rd and 5th degree polynomials exactly.
In general, an :math:`M`-point Gauss-Legendre rule integrates a polynomial
of degree :math:`2M+1` exactly.
The code `numint.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/fem/numint.py>`_ contains a large collection of Gauss-Legendre rules.

.. _fem:approx:2D:

Approximation of functions in 2D
================================

All the concepts and algorithms developed for approximation of 1D functions
:math:`f(x)` can readily be extended to 2D functions :math:`f(x,y)` and 3D functions
:math:`f(x,y,z)`. Basically, the extensions consists of defining basis functions
:math:`{\varphi}_i(x,y)` or :math:`{\varphi}_i(x,y,z)` over some domain :math:`\Omega`, and
for the least squares and Galerkin methods, the integration is done over
:math:`\Omega`.

.. _fem:approx:2D:global:

Global basis functions  (1)
---------------------------

An example will demonstrate the necessary extensions to use global
basis functions and the least squares, Galerkin/projection,
or interpolation/collocation
methods in 2D. The former two lead to linear systems


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^N A_{i,j}c_j &= b_i,\quad i=0,\ldots,N,\\
        A_{i,j} &= ({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j),\\
        b_i &= (f,{\varphi}_i),
        

where the inner product of two functions :math:`f(x,y)` and :math:`g(x,y)` is defined
completely analogously to the 1D case :eq:`fem:approx:LS:innerprod`:

.. math::
        
        (f,g) = \int_\Omega f(x,y)g(x,y) dx dy
        



Constructing 2D basis functions from 1D functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One straightforward
way to construct a basis in 2D is to combine
1D basis functions. Say we have the 1D basis


.. math::
         \{ \hat{\varphi}_0(x),\ldots,\hat{\varphi}_{N_x}(x)\}
        \thinspace .
        

We can now form 2D basis functions as products of 1D basis functions:
:math:`\hat{\varphi}_p(x)\hat{\varphi}_q(y)` for :math:`p=0,\ldots,N_x` and :math:`q=0,\ldots,N_y`.
We can either work with double indices,
:math:`{\varphi}_{p,q}(x,y) = \hat{\varphi}_p(x)\hat{\varphi}_q(y)`, and write


.. math::
         u = \sum_{p=0}^{N_y}\sum_{q=0}^{N_x} c_{p,q}{\varphi}_{p,q}(x,y),
        

or we may transform the double index :math:`(p,q)` to a single index :math:`i`,
using :math:`i=p N_y + q` or :math:`i=q N_x + p`.

Suppose we choose :math:`\hat{\varphi}_p(x)=x^p`, and try an approximation with
:math:`N_x=N_y=1`:


.. math::
         {\varphi}_{0,0}=1,\quad {\varphi}_{1,0}=x, \quad {\varphi}_{0,1}=y,
        \quad {\varphi}_{1,1}=xy
        \thinspace .
        

Using a mapping to one index like :math:`i=q N_x + p`, we get


.. math::
         {\varphi}_0=1,\quad {\varphi}_1=x, \quad {\varphi}_2=y,\quad{\varphi}_3 =xy
        \thinspace .
        


Hand calculations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the specific choice :math:`f(x,y) = (1+x^2)(1+2y^2)` on
:math:`\Omega = [0,L_x]\times [0,L_y]`, we can perform actual calculations:


.. math::
        
        A_{0,0} &= ({\varphi}_0,{\varphi}_0) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}
        {\varphi}_0(x,y)^2 dx dy = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}dx dy = L_xL_y,\\
        A_{1,0} &= ({\varphi}_1,{\varphi}_0) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x} x dxdy =
        \frac{1}{2}L_x^2L_y,\\
        A_{0,1} &= ({\varphi}_0,{\varphi}_1) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x} y dxdy =
        \frac{1}{2}L_y^2L_x,\\
        A_{0,1} &= ({\varphi}_0,{\varphi}_1) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x} xy dxdy =
        \int_0^{L_y}ydy \int_{0}^{L_x} xdx =
        \frac{1}{4}L_y^2L_x^2
        \thinspace .
        

The right-hand side vector has the entries


.. math::
        
        b_{0} &= ({\varphi}_0,f) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}1\cdot (1+x^2)(1+2y^2) dxdy
        = \int_0^{L_y}(1+2y^2)dy \int_{0}^{L_x} (1+x^2)dx\\
        &= (L_y + \frac{2}{3}L_y^3)(L_x + \frac{1}{3}L_x^3)\\
        b_{1} &= ({\varphi}_1,f) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x} x(1+x^2)(1+2y^2) dxdy =
        \int_0^{L_y}(1+2y^2)dy \int_{0}^{L_x} x(1+x^2)dx\\
        &= (L_y + \frac{2}{3}L_y^3)(\frac{1}{2}L_x^2 + \frac{1}{4}L_x^4)\\
        b_{2} &= ({\varphi}_2,f) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x} y(1+x^2)(1+2y^2) dxdy =
        \int_0^{L_y}y(1+2y^2)dy \int_{0}^{L_x} (1+x^2)dx\\
        &= (\frac{1}{2}L_y + \frac{1}{2}L_y^4)(L_x + \frac{1}{3}L_x^3)\\
        b_{3} &= ({\varphi}_2,f) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x} xy(1+x^2)(1+2y^2) dxdy =
        \int_0^{L_y}y(1+2y^2)dy \int_{0}^{L_x} x(1+x^2)dx\\
        &= (\frac{1}{2}L_y^2 + \frac{1}{2}L_y^4)(\frac{1}{2}L_x^2 + \frac{1}{4}L_x^4)
        \thinspace .
        


There is a general pattern in these calculations that we can explore.
An arbitrary matrix entry has the formula


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} &= ({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}
        {\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j dx dy \\
        &= \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}
        {\varphi}_{p,q}{\varphi}_{r,s} dx dy
        = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}
        \hat{\varphi}_p(x)\hat{\varphi}_q(y)\hat{\varphi}_r(x)\hat{\varphi}_s(y) dx dy\\
        &= \int_0^{L_y} \hat{\varphi}_q(y)\hat{\varphi}_s(y)dy
        \int_{0}^{L_x} \hat{\varphi}_p(x) \hat{\varphi}_r(x) dx\\
        &= \hat A^{(x)}_{p,r}\hat A^{(y)}_{q,s},
        

where


.. math::
         \hat A^{(x)}_{p,r} = \int_{0}^{L_x} \hat{\varphi}_p(x) \hat{\varphi}_r(x) dx,
        \quad
        \hat A^{(y)}_{q,s} = \int_0^{L_y} \hat{\varphi}_q(y)\hat{\varphi}_s(y)dy,
        

are matrix entries for one-dimensional approximations. Moreover,
:math:`i=q N_y+q` and :math:`j=s N_y+r`.

With :math:`\hat{\varphi}_p(x)=x^p` we have


.. math::
         \hat A^{(x)}_{p,r} = \frac{1}{p+r+1}L_x^{p+r+1},\quad
        \hat A^{(y)}_{q,s} = \frac{1}{q+s+1}L_y^{q+s+1},
        

and


.. math::
         A_{i,j} = \hat A^{(x)}_{p,r} \hat A^{(y)}_{q,s} =
        \frac{1}{p+r+1}L_x^{p+r+1} \frac{1}{q+s+1}L_y^{q+s+1},
        

for :math:`p,r=0,\ldots,N_x` and :math:`q,s=0,\ldots,N_y`.

Corresponding reasoning for the right-hand side leads to

.. math::
        
        b_i &= ({\varphi}_i,f) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}{\varphi}_i f\,dxdx\\
        &= \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}\hat{\varphi}_p(x)\hat{\varphi}_q(y) f\,dxdx\\
        &= \int_0^{L_y}\hat{\varphi}_q(y) (1+2y^2)dy
        \int_0^{L_y}\hat{\varphi}_p(x) x^p (1+x^2)dx\\
        &= \int_0^{L_y} y^q (1+2y^2)dy
        \int_0^{L_y}x^p (1+x^2)dx\\
        &= (\frac{1}{q+1} L_y^{q+1} + \frac{2}{q+3}L_y^{q+3})
        (\frac{1}{p+1} L_x^{p+1} + \frac{2}{q+3}L_x^{p+3})
        


Choosing :math:`L_x=L_y=2`, we have


.. math::
        
        A =
        \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
        4 & 4 & 4 & 4\\
        4 & \frac{16}{3} & 4 & \frac{16}{3}\\
        4 & 4 & \frac{16}{3} & \frac{16}{3}\\
        4 & \frac{16}{3} & \frac{16}{3} & \frac{64}{9}
        \end{array}\right],\quad
        b = \left[\begin{array}{c}
        \frac{308}{9}\\\frac{140}{3}\\44\\60\end{array}\right],
        \quad c = \left[
        \begin{array}{r}
        -\frac{1}{9}, \\
        \frac{4}{3}, \\
         - \frac{2}{3}, \\
         8
        \end{array}\right]
        \thinspace .
        

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:ubilinear` illustrates the result.

   *Approximation of a 2D quadratic function (left) by a 2D bilinear function (right) using the Galerkin or least squares method*




.. _fem:approx:2D:global:code:

Implementation  (3)
-------------------

The ``least_squares`` function from
the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:orth` and/or the
file `approx1D.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/fem/fe_approx1D.py>`_
can with very small modifications solve 2D approximation problems.
First, let ``Omega`` now be a list of the intervals in :math:`x` and :math:`y` direction.
For example, :math:`\Omega = [0,L_x]\times [0,L_y]` can be represented
by ``Omega = [[0, L_x], [0, L_y]]``.

Second, the symbolic integration must be extended to 2D:


.. code-block:: python

        import sympy as sm
        
        integrand = phi[i]*phi[j]
        I = sm.integrate(integrand,
                         (x, Omega[0][0], Omega[0][1]),
                         (y, Omega[1][0], Omega[1][1]))

provided ``integrand`` is an expression involving the ``sympy`` symbols ``x``
and ``y``.
The 2D version of numerical integration becomes


.. code-block:: python

        if isinstance(I, sm.Integral):
            integrand = sm.lambdify([x,y], integrand)
            I = sm.mpmath.quad(integrand,
                               [Omega[0][0], Omega[0][1]],
                               [Omega[1][0], Omega[1][1]])

The right-hand side integrals are modified in a similar way.

Third, we must construct a list of 2D basis functions, e.g.,


.. code-block:: python

        def taylor(x, y, Nx, Ny):
            return [x**i*y**j for i in range(Nx+1) for j in range(Ny+1)]
        
        def sines(x, y, Nx, Ny):
            return [sm.sin(sm.pi*(i+1)*x)*sm.sin(sm.pi*(j+1)*y)
                    for i in range(Nx+1) for j in range(Ny+1)]

The complete code appears in
`approx2D.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/fem/fe_approx2D.py>`_.

The previous hand calculation where a quadratic :math:`f` was approximated by
a bilinear function can be computed symbolically by


.. code-block:: python

        >>> f = (1+x**2)*(1+2*y**2)
        >>> phi = taylor(x, y, 1, 1)
        >>> Omega = [[0, 2], [0, 2]]
        >>> u = least_squares(f, phi, Omega)
        >>> print u
        8*x*y - 2*x/3 + 4*y/3 - 1/9
        >>> print sm.expand(f)
        2*x**2*y**2 + x**2 + 2*y**2 + 1

We may continue with adding higher powers to the basis and check that
with :math:`N_x\geq 2` and :math:`N_y\geq 2` we recover the exact function :math:`f`:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> phi = taylor(x, y, 2, 2)
        >>> u = least_squares(f, phi, Omega)
        >>> print u
        2*x**2*y**2 + x**2 + 2*y**2 + 1
        >>> print u-f
        0


Finite elements in 2D and 3D
============================

Finite element approximation is particularly powerful in 2D and 3D because
the method can handle a geometrically complex domain :math:`\Omega` with ease.
The principal idea is, as in 1D, to divide the domain into cells
use polynomials for approximating a function over a cell.
Two popular cell shapes are triangles and the quadrilaterals.
Figures :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:rectP1`, :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:circP1`,
and :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:rectQ1` provide examples. P1 elements
means linear functions (:math:`a_0 + a_1x + a_2y`) over triangles, while Q1 elements
have bilinear functions (:math:`a_0 + a_1x + a_2y + a_3xy`) over rectangular cells.
Higher-order elements can easily be defined.

Basis functions over triangles in the physical domain
-----------------------------------------------------

Cells with triangular shape will be in main focus here.  With the P1
triangular element, :math:`u` is a linear function over each cell, with
discontinuous derivatives at the cell boundaries, as depicted in
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:femfunc`.


.. _fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:femfunc:

.. figure:: fig-fem/demo2D_4x3r.png
   :width: 400

   *Example on piecewise linear 2D functions defined on triangles*


We give the vertices of the cells global and local numbers as in 1D.
The degrees of freedom in the P1 element are the function values at
a set of nodes, which are the three vertices.
The basis function :math:`{\varphi}_i(x,y)` is then 1 at the vertex with global vertex
number :math:`i` and zero at all other vertices.
On an element, the three degrees of freedom uniquely determine
the linear basis functions in that element, as usual.
The global
:math:`{\varphi}_i(x,y)` function is then a combination of the linear functions
(planar surfaces)
over all the neighboring cells
that have vertex number :math:`i` in common. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:basphi`
tries to illustrate the shape of such a "pyramid"-like function.

   :width: 400

   *Example on a piecewise linear 2D basis function over a patch of triangles*


Element matrices and vectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As in 1D, we split the integral over :math:`\Omega` into a sum of integrals
over cells. Also as in 1D, :math:`{\varphi}_i` overlaps :math:`{\varphi}_j`
(i.e., :math:`{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j\neq 0`) if and only if
:math:`i` and :math:`j` are vertices in the same cell. Therefore, the integral
of :math:`{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j` over an element is nonzero only when :math:`i` and :math:`j`
run over the vertex numbers in the element. These nonzero contributions
to the coefficient matrix are, as in 1D, collected in an element matrix.
The size of the element matrix becomes :math:`3\times 3` since there are
three degrees of freedom
that :math:`i` and :math:`j` run over. Again, as in 1D, we number the
local vertices in a cell, starting at 0, and add the entries in
the element matrix into the global system matrix, exactly as in 1D.
All details and code appear below.



Basis functions over triangles in the reference cell
----------------------------------------------------

As in 1D, we can define the basis functions and the degrees of freedom
in a reference cell and then use a mapping from the reference coordinate
system to the physical coordinate system.
We also have a mapping of local degrees of freedom numbers to global degrees
of freedom numbers.
.. (``dof_map``).


The reference cell in an :math:`(X,Y)` coordinate system has vertices
:math:`(0,0)`, :math:`(1,0)`, and :math:`(0,1)`, corresponding to local vertex numbers
0, 1, and 2, respectively. The P1 element has linear functions
:math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X,Y)` as basis functions, :math:`r=0,1,2`.
Since a linear function :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X,Y)` in 2D is on
the form :math:`C_{r,0} + C_{r,1}X + C_{r,2}Y`, and hence has three
parameters :math:`C_{r,0}`, :math:`C_{r,1}`, and :math:`C_{r,2}`, we need three
degrees of freedom. These are in general taken as the function values at a
set of nodes. For the P1 element the set of nodes is the three vertices.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P12D` displays the geometry of the
element and the location of the nodes.

   *2D P1 element*


Requiring :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r=1` at node number :math:`r` and
:math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r=0` at the two other nodes, gives three linear equations to
determine :math:`C_{r,0}`, :math:`C_{r,1}`, and :math:`C_{r,2}`. The result is


.. math::
        
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_0(X,Y) &= 1 - X - Y,\\
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_1(X,Y) &= X,\\
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_2(X,Y) &= Y
        


Higher-order approximations are obtained by increasing the polynomial order,
adding additional nodes, and letting the degrees of freedom be
function values at the nodes. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P22D`
shows the location of the six nodes in the P2 element.

.. 2DO: write up local basis funcs for P2


A polynomial of degree :math:`p` in :math:`X` and :math:`Y` has :math:`n_p=(p+1)(p+2)/2` terms
and hence needs :math:`n_p` nodes. The values at the nodes constitute :math:`n_p`
degrees of freedom. The location of the nodes for
:math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r` up to degree 6 is displayed in Figure
:ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P162D`.

   *2D P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6 elements*


The generalization to 3D is straightforward: the reference element is a
`tetrahedron <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron>`_
with vertices :math:`(0,0,0)`, :math:`(1,0,0)`, :math:`(0,1,0)`, and :math:`(0,0,1)`
in a :math:`X,Y,Z` reference coordinate system. The P1 element has its degrees
of freedom as four nodes, which are the four vertices, see Figure
:ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P1:123D`. The P2 element adds additional
nodes along the edges of the cell, yielding a total of 10 nodes and
degrees of freedom, see
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P2:123D`.

The interval in 1D, the triangle in 2D, the tetrahedron in 3D, and
its generalizations to higher space dimensions are known
as *simplex* cells (the geometry) or *simplex* elements (the geometry,
basis functions, degrees of freedom, etc.). The plural forms
`simplices <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex>`_ and
simplexes are
also a much used shorter terms when referring to this type of cells or elements.
The side of a simplex is called a *face*, while the tetrahedron also
has *edges*.

Affine mapping of the reference cell
------------------------------------

Let :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r^{(1)}` denote the basis functions associated
with the P1 element in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and let :math:`\pmb{x}_{q(e,r)}` be
the physical coordinates of local vertex number :math:`r` in cell :math:`e`.
Furthermore,
let :math:`\pmb{X}` be a point in the reference coordinate system corresponding
to the point :math:`\pmb{x}` in the physical coordinate system.
The affine mapping of any :math:`\pmb{X}` onto :math:`\pmb{x}` is
then defined by


.. index:: affine mapping



.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:affine:map
        
        \pmb{x} = \sum_{r} {\tilde{\varphi}}_r^{(1)}(\pmb{X})\pmb{x}_{q(e,r)},
        
        

where :math:`r` runs over the local vertex numbers in the cell.
The affine mapping maps the straight or planar faces of the reference cell onto
straight or planar faces in the physical coordinate system. The mapping can
be used for both P1 and higher-order elements.


.. _fem:approx:fe:map:fig:2DP1:

   :width: 400

   *Affine mapping of a P1 element*




Isoparametric mapping of the reference cell
-------------------------------------------


.. index:: isoparametric mapping

.. index::
   single: mapping of reference cells; isoparametric mapping


Instead of using the P1 basis functions in the mapping
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:affine:map`,
we may use the basis functions of the actual element:


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:isop:map
        
        \pmb{x} = \sum_{r} {\tilde{\varphi}}_r(\pmb{X})\pmb{x}_{q(e,r)},
        
        

where :math:`r` runs over all nodes, i.e., all points associated with the
degrees of freedom. This is called an *isoparametric mapping*.
For P1 elements it is identical to the affine mapping
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:affine:map`, but for higher-order elements
the mapping of the straight or planar faces of the reference cell will
result in a *curved* face in the physical coordinate system.
For example, when we use the basis functions of the triangular P2 element
in 2D in :eq:`fem:approx:fe:isop:map`, the straight faces of the
reference triangle are mapped onto curved faces of parabolic shape in
the physical coordinate system, see Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:map:fig:2DP2`.


.. _fem:approx:fe:map:fig:2DP2:

.. figure:: fig-fem/ElmT6n2D_map.png
   :width: 400

   *Isoparametric mapping of a P2 element*


From :eq:`fem:approx:fe:affine:map` or
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:isop:map` it is easy to realize that the
vertices are correctly mapped. Consider a vertex with local number :math:`s`.
Then :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_s=1` at this vertex and zero at the others.
This means that only one term in the sum is nonzero and :math:`\pmb{x}=\pmb{x}_{q(e,s)}`,
which is the coordinate of this vertex in the global coordinate system.


Computing integrals
-------------------

Let :math:`\tilde\Omega^r` denote the reference cell and :math:`\Omega^{(e)}`
the cell in the physical coordinate system. The transformation of
the integral from the physical to the reference coordinate system reads


.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}{\varphi}_i (\pmb{x}) {\varphi}_j (\pmb{x}) d\pmb{x} &=
        \int_{\tilde\Omega^r} {\tilde{\varphi}}_i (\pmb{X}) {\tilde{\varphi}}_j (\pmb{X})
        \det J\, d\pmb{X},\\
        \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}{\varphi}_i (\pmb{x}) f(\pmb{x}) d\pmb{x} &=
        \int_{\tilde\Omega^r} {\tilde{\varphi}}_i (\pmb{X}) f(\pmb{x}(\pmb{X})) \det J\, d\pmb{X},
        

where :math:`d\pmb{x} = dx dy` in 2D and :math:`d\pmb{x} = dx dy dz` in 3D, with a similar
definition of :math:`d\pmb{X}`. The quantity :math:`\det J` is the determinant of the
Jacobian of the mapping :math:`\pmb{x}(\pmb{X})`. In 2D,


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:2D:mapping:J:detJ
        
        J = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
        \frac{\partial x}{\partial X} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial Y}\\
        \frac{\partial y}{\partial X} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial Y}
        \end{array}\right], \quad
        \det J = \frac{\partial x}{\partial X}\frac{\partial y}{\partial Y}
        - \frac{\partial x}{\partial Y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial X}
        \thinspace .
        
        

With the affine mapping
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:affine:map`, :math:`\det J=2\Delta`, where :math:`\Delta` is
the area or volume of the cell in the physical coordinate system.

*Remark.* Observe that finite elements in 2D and 3D builds on the same
*ideas* and *concepts* as in 1D, but there is simply more to compute because the
specific mathematical formulas in 2D and 3D are more complicated.

A fundamental question is how accurate the finite element approximation

function, say :math:`f(x) = A\sin (\omega x)` on

by 2, 4, and 8 P1 and P2 elements. Compare

*Hint.* This :math:`f` can also be expressed in terms of the Heaviside function :math:`H(x)`:
:math:`f(x) = H(x-{1/2})`.
Therefore, :math:`f` can be defined by ``f = sm.Heaviside(x -  sm.Rational(1,2))``,
making the ``approximate`` function in the
``fe_approx1D.py`` module an obvious candidate to solve the
problem. However, ``sympy`` does not handle symbolic integration
with this particular integrand, and the ``approximate`` function faces a problem
when converting ``f`` to a Python function (for plotting) since
``Heaviside`` is not an available function in ``numpy``. It is better to make
special-purpose code for this case or perform all
calculations by hand.

.. _fem:deq:1D:principles:

Basic principles for approximating differential equations
=========================================================

The finite element method is a very flexible approach for solving partial
differential equations. Its two most attractive features are the ease
of handling domains of complex shape in two and three dimensions and
the ease of constructing higher-order discretization methods. The
finite element method is usually applied for discretization in space,
and therefore spatial problems will be our focus in the coming sections.
Extensions to time-dependent problems may, for instance, use finite difference
approximations in time.

Before studying how finite element methods are used to tackle differential
equation, we first look at how global basis functions and the
least squares, Galerkin, and collocation principles can be used to solve
differential equations.

.. _fem:deq:1D:models:

Differential equation models
----------------------------

Let us consider an abstract differential equation for a function :math:`u(x)` of
one variable, written as


.. math::
        
        {\cal L}(u) = 0,\quad x\in\Omega\thinspace . 

Here are a few examples on possible choices of :math:`{\cal L}(u)`, of
increasing complexity:


.. math::
        
        {\cal L}(u) &= \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} - f(x),
        \\
        {\cal L}(u) &= \frac{d}{dx}\left(a(x)\frac{du}{dx}\right) + f(x),
        \\
        {\cal L}(u) &= \frac{d}{dx}\left(a(u)\frac{du}{dx}\right) - \alpha u + f(x),
        \\
        {\cal L}(u) &= \frac{d}{dx}\left(a(u)\frac{du}{dx}\right) + f(u,x)
        
        \thinspace .
        

Both :math:`a(x)` and :math:`f(x)` are considered as specified functions,
while :math:`\alpha` is a prescribed parameter.  Differential equations
corresponding to :eq:`fem:deq:1D:L1`-:eq:`fem:deq:1D:L2` arise in
diffusion phenomena, such as steady transport of heat in solids and
flow of viscous fluids between flat plates. The form
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:L3` arises when transient diffusion or wave
phenomenon are discretized in time by finite differences. The equation
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:L4` appear in chemical models when diffusion of a
substance is combined with chemical reactions. Also in biology,
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:L4` plays an important role, both for spreading of
species and in models involving generation and
propagation of electrical signals.

Let :math:`\Omega =[0,L]` be the domain in one space dimension.
In addition to the differential equation, :math:`u` must fulfill
boundary conditions at the boundaries of the domain, :math:`x=0` and :math:`x=L`.
When :math:`{\cal L}` contains up to second-order derivatives, as in the
examples above, :math:`m=1`, we need one boundary condition at each of
the (two) boundary points, here abstractly specified as


.. math::
        
        {\cal B}_0(u)=0,\ x=0,\quad {\cal B}_1(u)=0,\ x=L
        


There are three common choices of boundary conditions:

.. math::
        
        {\cal B}_i(u) &= u - g,\quad \hbox{(Dirichlet condition)},\\
        {\cal B}_i(u) &= -a \frac{du}{dx} - g,\quad \hbox{(Neumann condition)},\\
        {\cal B}_i(u) &= -a \frac{du}{dx} - a(u-g),\quad \hbox{(Robin condition)}
        \thinspace .
        

Here, :math:`g` and :math:`a` are specified quantities.

From now on we shall use :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}(x)` as symbol for the *exact* solution,
fulfilling


.. math::
        
        {\cal L}(u_{\small\mbox{e}})=0,\quad x\in\Omega,
        

while :math:`u(x)` denotes an *approximate* solution of the differential
equation. We must immediately remark that
in the literature about the finite element method,
is common to use :math:`u` as the exact solution and :math:`u_h` as the
approximate solution, where :math:`h` is a discretization parameter. However,
the vast part of the present text is about the approximate solutions,
and having a subscript :math:`h` attached all the time
is cumbersome. Of equal importance is the close correspondence between
implementation and mathematics that we strive to achieve in this book:
when it is natural to use ``u`` and not ``u_h`` in
code, we let the mathematical notation be dictated by the code's
preferred notation. After all, it is the powerful computer implementations
of the finite element method that justifies studying the mathematical
formulation and aspects of the method.

A common model problem used much in the forthcoming examples is


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:model1
        
        -u''(x) = f(x),\quad x\in\Omega=[0,L],\quad u(0)=0,\ u(L)=D
        \thinspace .
        
        

The specific choice of :math:`f(x)=2` gives the solution


.. math::
         u_{\small\mbox{e}}(x) = x(\frac{D}{L}+L-x)
        \thinspace .
        

A closely related problem with a different boundary condition at
:math:`x=0` reads


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:model2
        
        -u''(x) = f(x),\quad x\in\Omega=[0,L],\quad u'(0)=C,\ u(L)=D\thinspace .
        
        

A third variant has a variable coefficient,


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:model3
        
        -(a(x)u'(x))' = f(x),\quad x\in\Omega=[0,L],\quad u'(0)=C,\ u(L)=D\thinspace .
        
        



.. _fem:deq:1D:residual:min:

Residual-minimizing principles
------------------------------

The fundamental idea is to seek an approximate solution
:math:`u` in some space :math:`V` with basis


.. math::
         \{ {\varphi}_0(x),\ldots,{\varphi}_N(x)\},

which means that :math:`u` can always be expressed as


.. math::
         u(x) = \sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j(x),

for some unknown coefficients :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`.
(Later, in the section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:essBC`, we will see that if we specify boundary values of :math:`u` different
from zero, we must look for an approximate solution
:math:`u(x) = B(x) + \sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j(x)`,
where :math:`\sum_{j}c_j{\varphi}_j\in V` and :math:`B(x)` is some function for
incorporating the right boundary values. Because of :math:`B(x)`, :math:`u` will not
necessarily lie in :math:`V`. This modification does not imply any difficulties.)
As in
the section :ref:`fem:approx:global`, we need principles for deriving :math:`N+1` equations to determine the
:math:`N+1` unknowns :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`.
A key idea of the section :ref:`fem:approx:global` was to minimize the
approximation error :math:`e=u-f`. That principle is not so useful here since
the approximation error :math:`e=u_{\small\mbox{e}} - u` is unknown to us when :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}` is
unknown. The only general indicator we have on the quality of the approximate
solution is to what degree :math:`u` fulfills the differential equation.
Inserting :math:`u=\sum_j c_j {\varphi}_j` into :math:`{\cal L}(u)` reveals that the
result is not zero, because :math:`u` is only likely to equal :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}`.
The nonzero result,


.. index:: residual



.. math::
        
        R = {\cal L}(u) = {\cal L}(\sum_j c_j {\varphi}_j),
        

is called the *residual* and measures the
error in fulfilling the governing equation.
Various principles for determining :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` try to minimize
:math:`R` in some sense. Note that :math:`R` varies with :math:`x` and
the :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` parameters. We may write this dependence
explicitly as


.. math::
        
        R = R(x; c_0,\ldots,c_N)\thinspace . 


The least squares method  (4)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The least-squares method aims to find :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` so that
the integrated square of the residual,


.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega} R^2 dx
        

is minimized. By introducing
an inner product of two functions :math:`f` and :math:`g`
on :math:`\Omega` as


.. math::
        
        (f,g) = \int_{\Omega} f(x)g(x) dx,
        

the least-squares method can be defined as


.. math::
        
        \min_{c_0,\ldots,c_N} E = (R,R)\thinspace . 

Differentiating with respect to the free parameters :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`
gives the :math:`N+1` equations


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:LS:eq1
        
        \int_{\Omega} 2R\frac{\partial R}{\partial c_i} dx = 0\quad
        \Leftrightarrow\quad (R,\frac{\partial R}{\partial c_i})=0,\quad
        i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace .
        
        


The Galerkin method  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The least-squares
principle is equivalent to demanding the error to be orthogonal to
the space :math:`V` when approximating a function :math:`f` by :math:`u\in V`.
With a differential equation
we do not know the true error so we must instead require the residual :math:`R`
to be orthogonal to :math:`V`. This idea implies
seeking :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` such that


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:Galerkin0
        
        (R,v)=0,\quad \forall v\in V\thinspace .
        
        

This is the Galerkin method for differential equations.
As shown in
:eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin` and
:eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin0`,
this statement is equivalent to :math:`R` being orthogonal to the :math:`N+1`
basis functions only:


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:Galerkin
        
        (R,{\varphi}_i)=0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        
        

resulting in :math:`N+1` equations for determining :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`.

The Method of Weighted Residuals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A generalization of the Galerkin method is to demand that :math:`R`
is orthogonal to some space :math:`W`, but not necessarily the same
space as :math:`V` where we seek the unknown function.
This generalization is naturally called the *method of weighted residuals*:


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:WRM0
        
        (R,v)=0,\quad \forall v\in W\thinspace .
        
        

If :math:`\{w_0,\ldots,w_N\}` is a basis for :math:`W`, we can equivalently
express the method of weighted residuals as


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:WRM
        
        (R,w_i)=0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace .
        
        

The result is :math:`N+1` equations for :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`.

The least-squares method can also be viewed as a weighted residual
method with :math:`w_i = \partial R/\partial c_i`.


.. index:: variational formulation


Variational Formulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Formulations like :eq:`fem:deq:1D:WRM0` (or
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:WRM`) and :eq:`fem:deq:1D:Galerkin0`
(or :eq:`fem:deq:1D:Galerkin`) are known as
*variational formulations*.
These equations are in this text primarily used for a numerical approximation
:math:`u\in V`, where :math:`V` is a *finite-dimensional* space with dimension
:math:`N+1`. However, we may also let :math:`V` be an *infinite-dimensional* space
containing the exact solution :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}(x)` such that also :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}`
fulfills a variational formulation. The variational formulation is in
that case a mathematical way of stating the problem and acts as an
alternative to the usual formulation of a differential equation with
initial and/or boundary conditions.


.. index:: trial function

.. index:: test function

.. index:: trial space

.. index:: test space


Test and Trial Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the context of the Galerkin method and the method of weighted residuals it is
common to use the name *trial function* for the approximate :math:`u =
\sum_j c_j {\varphi}_j`.
.. Sometimes the functions that spans the space where :math:`u` lies are also called

.. trial functions.

The space containing the trial function is known as the *trial space*.
The function :math:`v` entering the orthogonality requirement in
the Galerkin method and the method of weighted residuals is called
*test function*, and so are the :math:`{\varphi}_i` or :math:`w_i` functions that are
used as weights in the inner products with the residual.  The space
where the test functions comes from is naturally called the
*test space*.

We see that in the method of weighted residuals the test and trial spaces
are different and so are the test and trial functions.
In the Galerkin method the test and trial spaces are the same (so far).
Later in the section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:essBC` we shall see that boundary
conditions may lead to a difference between the test and trial spaces
in the Galerkin method.

*Remark.* It may be subject to debate whether
it is only the form of :eq:`fem:deq:1D:WRM0` or :eq:`fem:deq:1D:Galerkin0`
after integration by parts, as explained in the section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:varform`,
that qualifies for the term variational formulation. The result after
integration by parts is what is obtained after taking the *first
variation* of an optimization problem, see the section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:optimization`. However, here we use variational formulation as a common term for
formulations which, in contrast to the differential equation :math:`R=0`,
instead demand that an average of :math:`R` is zero: :math:`(R,v)=0` for all :math:`v` in some space.

The collocation method  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea of the collocation method is to demand that :math:`R` vanishes
at :math:`N+1` selected points :math:`x_{0},\ldots,x_{N}` in :math:`\Omega`:


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:collocation
        
        R(x_{i}; c_0,\ldots,c_N)=0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace .
        
        

The collocation method can also be viewed as a method of weighted residuals
with Dirac delta functions as weighting functions.
Let :math:`\delta (x-x_{i})` be the Dirac delta function centered around
:math:`x=x_{i}` with the properties that :math:`\delta (x-x_{i})=0` for :math:`x\neq x_{i}`
and


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:Dirac
        
        \int_{\Omega} f(x)\delta (x-x_{i}) dx = f(x_{i}),\quad x_{i}\in\Omega\thinspace .
        
        

Intuitively, we may think of :math:`\delta (x-x_{i})` as a very peak-shaped
function around :math:`x=x_{i}` with integral 1, roughly visualized
in Figure :ref:`fem:deq:1D:fig:Dirac`.
Because of :eq:`fem:deq:1D:Dirac`, we can let :math:`w_i=\delta(x-x_{i})`
be weighting functions in the method of weighted residuals,
and :eq:`fem:deq:1D:WRM` becomes equivalent to
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:collocation`.


.. _fem:deq:1D:fig:Dirac:

.. figure:: fig-fem/delta_func_weight.png
   :width: 400

   *Approximation of delta functions by narrow Gaussian functions*



The subdomain collocation method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea of this approach is to demand the integral of :math:`R` to vanish
over :math:`N+1` subdomains :math:`\Omega_i` of :math:`\Omega`:


.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega_i} R\, dx=0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace . 

This statement can also be expressed as a weighted residual method


.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega} Rw_i\, dx=0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N, 

where :math:`w_i=1` for :math:`x\in\Omega_i` and :math:`w_i=0` otherwise.


.. _fem:deq:1D:ex:sines:

Examples on using the principles
--------------------------------

Let us now apply global basis functions to illustrate the principles
for minimizing :math:`R`.

The model problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We consider the differential equation problem


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:model1b
        
        -u''(x) = f(x),\quad x\in\Omega=[0,L],\quad u(0)=0,\ u(L)=0
        \thinspace .
        
        


Basis functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our choice of basis functions :math:`{\varphi}_i`
for :math:`V` is


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:ex:sines:phi
        
        {\varphi}_i(x) = {\sin\left((i+1)\pi\frac{x}{L}\right)},\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace .
        
        


An important property of these functions is that :math:`{\varphi}_i(0)={\varphi}_i(L)=0`,
which means that the boundary conditions on :math:`u` are fulfilled:


.. math::
         u(0) = \sum_jc_j{\varphi}_j(0) = 0,\quad u(L) = \sum_jc_j{\varphi}_j(L)
        \thinspace .


Another nice property is that the chosen sine functions
are orthogonal on :math:`\Omega`:


.. math::
        
        \int\limits_0^L {\sin\left((i+1)\pi\frac{x}{L}\right)}{\sin\left((j+1)\pi\frac{x}{L}\right)}\, dx = \left\lbrace
        \begin{array}{ll} \frac{1}{2} L & i=j  \\ 0, & i\neq j
        \end{array}\right.
        

provided :math:`i` and :math:`j` are integers.


The residual
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can readily calculate the following explicit expression for the
residual:


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:ex:sines:res
        
        R(x;c_0,\ldots,c_N) &= u''(x) + f(x),\nonumber\\
        &= \frac{d^2}{dx^2}\left(\sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j(x)\right)
        + f(x),\nonumber\\
        &= -\sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j''(x) + f(x)\thinspace .
        
        


The least squares method  (5)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The equations :eq:`fem:deq:1D:LS:eq1`
in the least squares method require an expression for
:math:`\partial R/\partial c_i`. We have


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial R}{\partial c_i} =
        \frac{\partial}{\partial c_i}
        \left(\sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j''(x) + f(x)\right)
        = \sum_{j=0}^N \frac{\partial c_j}{\partial c_i}{\varphi}_j''(x)
        = {\varphi}_i''(x)\thinspace . 

The governing equations for :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` are then


.. math::
        
        (\sum_j c_j {\varphi}_j'' + f,{\varphi}_i'')=0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        

which can be rearranged as


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^N({\varphi}_i'',{\varphi}_j'')c_j = -(f,{\varphi}_i''),\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace . 

This is nothing but a linear system


.. math::
         \sum_{j=0}^NA_{i,j}c_j = b_i,\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        

with


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} &= ({\varphi}_i'',{\varphi}_j'')\nonumber\\
        & = \pi^4(i+1)^2(j+1)^2L^{-4}\int_0^L {\sin\left((i+1)\pi\frac{x}{L}\right)}{\sin\left((j+1)\pi\frac{x}{L}\right)}\, dx\nonumber\\
        &= \left\lbrace
        \begin{array}{ll} {1\over2}L^{-3}\pi^4(i+1)^4 & i=j  \\ 0, & i\neq j
        \end{array}\right.
        \\
        b_i &= -(f,{\varphi}_i'') = (i+1)^2\pi^2L^{-2}\int_0^Lf(x){\sin\left((i+1)\pi\frac{x}{L}\right)}\, dx
        

Since the coefficient matrix is diagonal we can easily solve for


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:ex:sines:solution
        
        c_i = \frac{2L}{\pi^2(i+1)^2}\int_0^Lf(x){\sin\left((i+1)\pi\frac{x}{L}\right)}\, dx\thinspace .
        
        

With the special choice of :math:`f(x)=2` the integral becomes


.. math::
         \frac{L\cos(\pi i) + L}{\pi (i+1)},

according to `WolframAlpha <http://wolframalpha.com>`_
(use ``j`` and not ``i``, which means :math:`=\sqrt{-1}`,
when asking). Hence,


.. math::
         c_i = \frac{4L^2(1+(-1)^i)}{\pi^3(i+1)^3}\thinspace .
        

Now, :math:`1+(-1)^i=0` for :math:`i` odd, so only the coefficients with even index
are nonzero. Introducing :math:`i=2k` for :math:`k=0,\ldots,N/2` to count the
relevant indices, we get the solution


.. math::
        
        u(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{N/2} \frac{8L^2}{\pi^3(2k+1)^3}{\sin\left((2k+1)\pi\frac{x}{L}\right)}\thinspace . 

The coefficients decay very fast: :math:`c_2 = c_0/27`, :math:`c_4=c_0/125`.
The solution will therefore be dominated by the first term,


.. math::
         u(x) \approx \frac{8L^2}{\pi^3}\sin\left(\pi\frac{x}{L}\right)\thinspace . 



The Galerkin method  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Galerkin principle :eq:`fem:deq:1D:Galerkin0`
applied to :eq:`fem:deq:1D:model1b` consists of inserting
our special residual :eq:`fem:deq:1D:ex:sines:res` in
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:Galerkin0`


.. math::
        
        (u''+f,v)=0,\quad \forall v\in V,
        

or


.. math::
        
        (u'',v) = -(f,v),\quad\forall v\in V\thinspace . 

This is the variational formulation, based on the Galerkin principle,
of our differential equation.
The :math:`\forall v\in V` requirement is equivalent to
demanding the equation :math:`(u'',v) = -(f,v)` to be fulfilled for all
basis functions :math:`v={\varphi}_i`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N` (cf.
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:Galerkin0` and :eq:`fem:deq:1D:Galerkin`).
This gives


.. math::
        
        (\sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j'', {\varphi}_i)=-(f,{\varphi}_i),\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace . 

This equation can be rearranged to a form that explicitly shows
that we get a linear system for the unknowns :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`:


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^N ({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j'')c_j = (f, {\varphi}_i),\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace . 

For the particular choice of the basis functions :eq:`fem:deq:1D:ex:sines:phi`
we get in fact the same linear system
as in the least squares method
(because :math:`{\varphi}''= -(i+1)^2\pi^2L^{-2}{\varphi}`).

The collocation method  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the collocation method :eq:`fem:deq:1D:collocation` we need to
decide upon a set of :math:`N+1` collocation points in :math:`\Omega`. A simple
choice is to use uniformly spaced points: :math:`x_{i}=i\Delta x`, where
:math:`\Delta x = L/N` in our case (:math:`N\geq 1`). However, these points
lead to at least two rows in the matrix consisting of zeros
(since :math:`{\varphi}_i(x_{0})=0` and :math:`{\varphi}_i(x_{N})=0`), thereby making the matrix
singular and non-invertible. This forces us to choose some other
collocation points, e.g., random points or points uniformly distributed
in the interior of :math:`\Omega`.
Demanding the residual to vanish
at these points leads, in our model problem :eq:`fem:deq:1D:model1b`, to
the equations


.. math::
        
        -\sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j''(x_{i}) = f(x_{i}),\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        

which is seen to be a linear system with entries


.. math::
         A_{i,j}=-{\varphi}_j''(x_{i})=
        (j+1)^2\pi^2L^{-2}\sin\left((j+1)\pi \frac{x_i}{L}\right),

in the coefficient matrix and entries
:math:`b_i=2` for the right-hand side (when :math:`f(x)=2`).

The special case of :math:`N=0`
can sometimes be of interest. A natural choice is then the midpoint
:math:`x_{0}=L/2` of the domain, resulting in
:math:`A_{0,0} = -{\varphi}_0''(x_{0}) = \pi^2L^{-2}`, :math:`f(x_0)=2`,
and hence :math:`c_0=2L^2/\pi^2`.


Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~

In the present model problem, with :math:`f(x)=2`, the exact solution is
:math:`u(x)=x(L-x)`, while for :math:`N=0` the Galerkin and least squares method
result in :math:`u(x)=8L^2\pi^{-3}\sin (\pi x/L)` and the
collocation method leads to :math:`u(x)=2L^2\pi^{-2}\sin (\pi x/L)`.
Since all methods fulfill the boundary conditions :math:`u(0)=u(L)=0`, we
expect the largest discrepancy to occur at the midpoint of the domain:
:math:`x=L/2`. The error at the midpoint becomes :math:`-0.008L^2` for the
Galerkin and least squares method, and :math:`0.047L^2` for the collocation
method.



.. _fem:deq:1D:varform:

Integration by parts
--------------------


.. index:: integration by parts


A problem arises if we want to use the finite element functions from
the section :ref:`fem:approx:fe` to solve our model problem :eq:`fem:deq:1D:model1b`
by the least squares, Galerkin, or collocation methods: the piecewise
polynomials :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` have discontinuous derivatives at the
cell boundaries which makes it problematic to compute
:math:`{\varphi}_i''(x)`.  This fact actually makes the least squares and
collocation methods less suitable for finite element approximation of
the unknown function. (By rewriting the equation :math:`-u''=f` as a
system of two first-order equations, :math:`u'=v` and :math:`-v'=f`, the
least squares method can be applied. Also, differentiating discontinuous
functions can actually be handled by distribution theory in
mathematics.)  The Galerkin method and the method of
weighted residuals can, however, be applied together with finite
element basis functions if we use *integration by parts*
as a means for transforming a second-order derivative to a first-order
one.

Consider the model problem :eq:`fem:deq:1D:model1b` and its
Galerkin formulation


.. math::
         -(u'',v) = (f,v)\quad\forall v\in V\thinspace . 

Using integration by parts in the Galerkin method,
we can move a derivative on :math:`u` to :math:`v`:


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:intbyparts
        
        \int_0^L u''(x)v(x) dx &= - \int_0^Lu'(x)v'(x)dx
        + [vu']_0^L\nonumber\\
        &= - \int_0^Lu'(x)v'(x) dx
        + u'(L)v(L) - u'(0)v(0)\thinspace .
        
        

Usually, one integrates the problem at the stage where the :math:`u` and :math:`v`
functions enter the formulation.
Alternatively, but less common, we can integrate by parts in the expressions for
the matrix entries:


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:intbyparts0
        
        \int_0^L{\varphi}_i(x){\varphi}_j''(x) dx &= - \int_0^L{\varphi}_i'(x){\varphi}_j'(x) dx
        + [{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j']_0^L\nonumber\\
        &= - \int_0^L{\varphi}_i'(x){\varphi}_j'(x) dx
        + {\varphi}_i(L){\varphi}_j'(L) - {\varphi}_i(0){\varphi}_j'(0)\thinspace .
        
        

Integration by parts serves to reduce the order of the derivatives and
to make the coefficient matrix symmetric since
:math:`({\varphi}_i',{\varphi}_j') = ({\varphi}_i',{\varphi}_j')`. The symmetry property depends
on the type of terms that enter the differential equation.
As will be seen later in the section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:BC:nat`,
integration by parts also provides a method for implementing
boundary conditions involving :math:`u'`.

With the choice :eq:`fem:deq:1D:ex:sines:phi` of basis functions we see
that the "boundary terms" :math:`{\varphi}_i(L){\varphi}_j'(L)` and :math:`{\varphi}_i(0){\varphi}_j'(0)`
vanish since :math:`{\varphi}_i(0)={\varphi}_i(L)=0`. A boundary term associated with
a location at the boundary where we have Dirichlet conditions will always
vanish because :math:`{\varphi}_i=0` at such locations.


.. index:: weak form

.. index:: strong form


Since the variational formulation after integration by parts make
weaker demands on the differentiability of :math:`u` and the basis
functions :math:`{\varphi}_i`,
the resulting integral formulation is referred to as a *weak form* of
the differential equation problem. The original variational formulation
with second-order derivatives, or the differential equation problem
with second-order derivative, is then the *strong form*, with
stronger requirements on the differentiability of the functions.

For differential equations with second-order derivatives, expressed as
variational formulations and solved by finite element methods, we will
always perform integration by parts to arrive at expressions involving
only first-order derivatives.


.. _fem:deq:1D:essBC:Bfunc:

Boundary function
-----------------

So far we have assumed zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, typically
:math:`u(0)=u(L)=0`, and we have demanded that :math:`{\varphi}_i(0){\varphi}_i(L)=0`
for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`. What about a boundary condition like :math:`u(L)=D\neq0`?
This condition immediately faces a problem with
:math:`u=\sum_{j=0}^N c_j {\varphi}_j`, because :math:`u(L)=0` since all the
basis functions vanish at :math:`x=L`.

A boundary condition of the form :math:`u(L)=D` can be implemented by
demanding that all :math:`{\varphi}_i(L)=0`, but adding a
*boundary function* :math:`B(x)` with the right boundary value, :math:`B(L)=D`, to
the expansion for :math:`u`:


.. math::
         u(x) = B(x) + \sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j(x)
        \thinspace .
        

This :math:`u` gets the right value at :math:`x=L`:


.. math::
         u(L) = B(L) + \sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j(L) = B(L) = D\thinspace . 

The idea is that for any boundary where :math:`u` is known we demand :math:`{\varphi}_i` to
vanish and construct a function :math:`B(x)` to attain the boundary value of :math:`u`.
There are no restrictions how :math:`B(x)` varies with :math:`x` in the interior of the
domain, so this variation needs to be constructed in some way.

For example, with :math:`u(0)=0` and
:math:`u(L)=D`, we can choose :math:`B(x)=x D/L`, since :math:`B(0)=0` and :math:`B(L)=D`.
The unknown function is then sought on the form


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:essBC:Bfunc:u1
        
        u(x) = \frac{x}{L}D + \sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j(x),
        
        

with :math:`{\varphi}_i(0)={\varphi}_i(L)=0`.

The :math:`B(x)` function can be chosen in many ways as long as its boundary
values are correct. For example, :math:`B(x)=D(x/L)^p` for any power :math:`p`
will work fine in the above example.
As another example, consider a domain :math:`\Omega = [a,b]`
where the boundary conditions are :math:`u(a)=U_a` and :math:`u(b)=U_b`.  A class
of possible :math:`B(x)` functions is


.. math::
         B(x)=U_a + \frac{U_b-U_a}{(b-a)^p}(x-a)^p,\quad p>0
        \thinspace . 


To summarize, the procedure goes as follows.
Let :math:`\partial\Omega_E` be the part(s) of the boundary
:math:`\partial\Omega` of the domain :math:`\Omega` where :math:`u` is specified.
Set :math:`{\varphi}_i=0` at the points in :math:`\partial\Omega_E` and seek :math:`u`
as


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:essBC:Bfunc:u2
        
        u(x) = B(x) + \sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j(x),
        
        

where :math:`B(x)` equals the boundary conditions on :math:`u` at :math:`\partial\Omega_E`.

*Remark.* With the :math:`B(x)` term, :math:`u` does not in general lie in :math:`V=\hbox{span}\,
\{{\varphi}_0,\ldots,{\varphi}_N\}` anymore. Moreover, when a prescribed value
of :math:`u` at the boundary, say :math:`u(a)=U_a` is different from zero, it does
not make sense to say that :math:`u` lies in a vector space, because
this space does not obey the requirements of addition and scalar multiplication.
For example,
:math:`2u` does not lie in the space since its boundary value is :math:`2U_a`,
which is incorrect. It only makes sense to split :math:`u` in two parts,
as done above, and have the unknown part :math:`\sum_j c_j {\varphi}_j` in a
proper function space.
.. Sometimes it is said that :math:`u` is in the *affine space* :math:`B+V`.


.. _fem:deq:1D:varform:abstract:

Abstract notation for variational formulations
----------------------------------------------

We have seen that variational formulations end up with a formula involving
:math:`u` and :math:`v`, such as :math:`(u',v')` and a formula involving :math:`v` and known
functions, such as :math:`(f,v)`. A common notation is to introduce an abstract
variational statement written as :math:`a(u,v)=L(v)`,
where :math:`a(u,v)` is a so-called *bilinear form* involving all the terms
that contain both the test and trial
function, while :math:`L(v)` is a *linear form* containing all the terms without
the trial function. For example, the statement


.. math::
         \int_{\Omega} u' v'dx = \int_{\Omega} fvdx\quad\hbox{or}\quad (u',v') = (f,v)
        \quad\forall v\in V

can be written in abstract form: *find :math:`u` such that*


.. math::
         a(u,v) = L(v)\quad \forall v\in V,

where we have the definitions


.. math::
         a(u,v) = (u',v'),\quad L(v) = (f,v)\thinspace . 


The term *linear* means that :math:`L(\alpha_1 v_1 + \alpha_2 v_2)
=\alpha_1 L(v_1) + \alpha_2 L(v_2)` for two test functions :math:`v_1` and :math:`v_2`, and
scalar parameters :math:`\alpha_1` and :math:`\alpha_2`. Similarly, the term *bilinear*
means that :math:`a(u,v)` are linear in both its arguments:

.. math::
        
        a(\alpha_1 u_1 + \alpha_2 u_2, v) &= \alpha_1 a(u_1,v) + \alpha_2 a(u_2, v),
        \\
        a(u, \alpha_1 v_1 + \alpha_2 v_2) &= \alpha_1 a(u,v_1) + \alpha_2 a(u, v_2)
        \thinspace .
        

In nonlinear problems these linearity properties do not hold in general
and the abstract notation is then :math:`F(u;v)=0`.

The matrix system associated with :math:`a(u,v)=L(v)` can also be written in
an abstract form by inserting :math:`v={\varphi}_i` and :math:`u=\sum_j c_j{\varphi}_j`
in :math:`a(u,v)=L(v)`. Using the linear properties, the system becomes


.. math::
         \sum_{j=0}^N a({\varphi}_j,{\varphi}_i) c_j = L({\varphi}_i),\quad i=0,\ldots,N
        \thinspace .
        

From this we see that the matrix element :math:`A_{i,j}` equals
:math:`a({\varphi}_j,{\varphi}_i)`. In many problems, :math:`a(u,v)` is symmetric so that
:math:`a({\varphi}_j,{\varphi}_i) = a({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j)`.

The abstract notation :math:`a(u,v)=L(v)` for linear problems
is much used in the literature and
in description of finite element software (in particular the
`FEniCS <http://fenicsproject.org>`_ documentation). We shall
frequently summarize variational forms using this notation.


.. _fem:deq:1D:varform:ex:

More examples on variational formulations
-----------------------------------------

Variable coefficient
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the problem


.. math::
        
        -\frac{d}{dx}\left( a(x)\frac{du}{dx}\right) = f(x),\quad x\in\Omega =[0,L],\
        u(0)=C,\ u(L)=D\thinspace .
        

There are two new features of this problem compared with
previous examples: a variable
coefficient :math:`a(x)` and nonzero Dirichlet conditions at both boundary points.

Let us first deal with the boundary conditions. We seek


.. math::
         u(x) = B(x) + \sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_i(x),

with :math:`{\varphi}_i(0)={\varphi}_i(L)=0` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`. The function :math:`B(x)`
must then fulfill :math:`B(0)=C` and :math:`B(L)=D`. How :math:`B` varies in between
:math:`x=0` and :math:`x=L` is not of importance. One possible choice is


.. math::
         B(x) = C + \frac{1}{L}(D-C)x
        \thinspace .
        


The residual arises by inserting our :math:`u` in the differential equation:


.. math::
         R = -\frac{d}{dx}\left( a\frac{du}{dx}\right) -f\thinspace .

Galerkin's method is


.. math::
        
        (R, v) = 0,\quad \forall v\in V,
        

or written with explicit integrals,

.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega} \left(\frac{d}{dx}\left( a\frac{du}{dx}\right) -f\right)v dx = 0,\quad \forall v\in V \thinspace .
        

We proceed with integration by parts to lower the derivative from
second to first order:


.. math::
         -\int_{\Omega} \frac{d}{dx}\left( a(x)\frac{du}{dx}\right) vdx
        = \int_{\Omega} a(x)\frac{du}{dx}\frac{dv}{dx}dx -
        \left[a\frac{du}{dx}v\right]_0^L
        \thinspace .
        

Since all functions in :math:`v` have the property :math:`v(0)=v(L)=0`, the boundary
term vanishes. The variational formulation is then


.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega} a(x)\frac{du}{dx}\frac{dv}{dx}dx = \int_{\Omega} f(x)vdx,\quad
        \forall v\in V\thinspace .
        

The variational formulation can alternatively be written in a more
compact form:


.. math::
        
        (a u',v') = (f,v),\quad \forall v\in V
        \thinspace .
        

The corresponding abstract notation reads


.. math::
         a(u,v)=L(v)\quad\forall v\in V,

with

.. math::
         a(u,v)= (au',v'),\quad L(v)=(f,v) \thinspace . 

Note that the :math:`a` in the notation :math:`a(\cdot,\cdot)` is not to be mixed with the
variable coefficient :math:`a(x)` in the differential equation.

We may insert :math:`u=B + \sum_jc_j{\varphi}_j` and :math:`v={\varphi}_i` to
derive the linear system:


.. math::
        
        (aB' + a\sum_{j=0}^N c_j {\varphi}_j', {\varphi}_i') =
        (f,{\varphi}_i), \quad i=0,\ldots,N \thinspace .
        

Isolating everything with the :math:`c_j` coefficients on the left-hand side
and all known terms on the right-hand side
gives


.. math::
         \sum_{j=0}^N (a{\varphi}_j', {\varphi}_i')c_j  =
        (f,{\varphi}_i) + (a(D-C)L^{-1}, {\varphi}_i'), \quad i=0,\ldots,N
        \thinspace .
        

This is nothing but a linear system :math:`\sum_j A_{i,j}c_j=b_i`
with


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} &= (a{\varphi}_j', {\varphi}_i') = \int_{\Omega} a(x){\varphi}_j'(x),
        {\varphi}_i'(x)dx,\\
        b_i &= (f,{\varphi}_i) + (a(D-C)L^{-1},{\varphi}_i')=
        \int_{\Omega} \left(f(x){\varphi}_i(x) + a(x)\frac{D-C}{L}{\varphi}_i'(x)\right) dx
        \thinspace .
        


First-order derivative in the equation and boundary condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next problem to formulate in variational form reads


.. math::
        
        -u''(x) + bu'(x) = f(x),\quad x\in\Omega =[0,L],\
        u(0)=C,\ u'(L)=E\thinspace .
        

The new features are a first-order derivative :math:`u'` in the equation
and the boundary
condition involving the derivative: :math:`u'(L)=E`.
Since we have a Dirichlet condition at :math:`x=0`,
we force :math:`{\varphi}_i(0)=0` and use a boundary function :math:`B(x)=C(L-x)/L`
to take care of the condition :math:`u(0)=C`. Because there is no Dirichlet
condition on :math:`x=L` we do not make any requirements to :math:`{\varphi}_i(L)`.
The expansion for :math:`u` becomes


.. math::
         u = \frac{C}{L}(L-x) + \sum_{j=0}^N c_j {\varphi}_i(x)
        \thinspace .
        


The variational formulation arises from multiplying the equation by
a test function :math:`v\in V` and integrating over :math:`\Omega`:


.. math::
          (-u'' + bu' - f, v) = 0,\quad\forall v\in V

We apply integration by parts to the :math:`u''v` term only. Although we could
also integrate :math:`u' v` by parts, this is not common.
The result becomes


.. math::
         (u' + bu',v') = (f,v) + [u' v]_0^L, \quad\forall v\in V \thinspace .

Now, :math:`v(0)=0` so :math:`[u' v]_0^L = u'(L)v(L) = E v(L)`. We realize that when
integrating by parts, *the boundary term can be used to implement
Neumann conditions*.


.. index:: natural boundary condition

.. index:: essential boundary condition


Another very important result is that *omitting the boundary term*
implies, in general, that we actually impose the condition :math:`u'=0` unless there
is a Dirichlet condition at that point! This result has great
practical consequences, because it is easy to forget the boundary
term, and this mistake implicitly
sets a boundary condition. Since Neumann conditions can be incorporated
without doing anything, or simply inserting the condition in a
boundary term, such conditions are known as *natural boundary conditions*.
Dirichlet conditions requires more essential steps in the mathematical
formulation and are
therefore known as *essential boundary conditions*.

The variational form now reads


.. math::
         (u',v') + (bu',v) = (f,v) + E v(L), \quad\forall v\in V \thinspace .

In the abstract notation we have


.. math::
         a(u,v)=L(v)\quad\forall v\in V,

with the particular formulas

.. math::
         a(u,v)=(u',v') + (bu',v),\quad L(v)= (f,v) + E v(L)\thinspace .


The associated linear system is derived by inserting :math:`u=B+\sum_jc_j{\varphi}_j`
and replacing :math:`v` by :math:`{\varphi}_i` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`. Some algebra results in


.. math::
         \sum_{j=0}^N \underbrace{(({\varphi}_j',{\varphi}_i') + (b{\varphi}_j',{\varphi}_i))}_{A_{i,j}} c_j = \underbrace{(f,{\varphi}_i) + (bCL^{-1},{\varphi}_i') + E {\varphi}_i(L)}_{b_i}
        \thinspace .
        

Observe that in this problem, the coefficient matrix is not symmetric,
because of the term


.. math::
        
        (b{\varphi}_j',{\varphi}_i)=\int_{\Omega} b{\varphi}_j'{\varphi}_i dx
         \neq \int_{\Omega} b {\varphi}_i' {\varphi}_jdx = ({\varphi}_i',b{\varphi}_j)
        \thinspace .
        


For finite element basis functions, it is worth noticing that the boundary term
:math:`E{\varphi}_i(L)` is nonzero only in the entry :math:`b_N` since all
:math:`{\varphi}_i`, :math:`i\neq N`, are zero at :math:`x=L`, provided the degrees of freedom
are numbered from left to right in 1D so that :math:`x_{N}=L`.

Nonlinear terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, we show that the techniques used above to derive variational
forms also apply to nonlinear PDE problems as well. Here is a model problem with
a nonlinear coefficient and right-hand side:


.. math::
        
        -(a(u)u')' = f(u),\quad x\in [0,L],\ u(0)=0,\ u'(L)=E
        \thinspace .
        

Using the Galerkin principle, we multiply by :math:`v\in V` and integrate,


.. math::
         -\int_0^L \frac{d}{dx}\left(a(u)\frac{du}{dx}\right)vdx =
        \int_0^L f(u)vdx\quad\forall v\in V
        \thinspace .
        

The integration by parts does not differ from the case where we have
:math:`a(x)` instead of :math:`a(u)`:


.. math::
         \int_0^L a(u)\frac{du}{dx}\frac{dv}{dx}dx =
        \int_0^L f(u)vdx + [avu']_0^L\quad\forall v\in V
        \thinspace .
        

We require that :math:`v(0)=0` since :math:`u(0)` is known. The other term, :math:`v(L)u'(L)`,
is used to impose the other boundary condition :math:`u'(L)=E`, resulting in


.. math::
         \int_0^L a(u)\frac{du}{dx}\frac{dv}{dx}vdx =
        \int_0^L f(u)vdx + a(L)v(L)E\quad\forall v\in V,
        

or alternatively written more compactly as


.. math::
         (a(u)u', v') = (f(u),v) + a(L)v(L)E\quad\forall v\in V
        \thinspace .
        

Since the problem is nonlinear, we cannot identify a bilinear
form :math:`a(u,v)` and a linear form :math:`L(v)`.
An abstract notation is typically *find :math:`u` such that*


.. math::
         F(u;v) = 0\quad\forall v\in V,

with

.. math::
         F(u;v) = (a(u)u', v') - (f(u),v) - a(L)v(L)E
        \thinspace .
        


By inserting :math:`u=\sum_j c_j{\varphi}_j` we get a *nonlinear system of
algebraic equations* for the unknowns :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`. Such systems must
be solved by constructing a sequence of linear systems whose solutions
converge to the solution of the nonlinear system. Frequently applied
methods are Picard iteration and Newton's method.


Example on computing with Dirichlet and Neumann conditions
----------------------------------------------------------

.. ex_varform1D.py: case2


Let us perform the necessary calculations to solve


.. math::
         -u''(x)=2,\quad x\in \Omega=[0,1],\quad u'(0)=C,\ u(1)=D,

using a global polynomial basis :math:`{\varphi}_i\sim x^i`.
The requirements on :math:`{\varphi}_i` is that :math:`{\varphi}_i(1)=0`, because :math:`u` is
specified at :math:`x=1`, so a proper set of polynomial basis functions are
:math:`{\varphi}_i(x)=(1-x)^{i+1}`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`. A suitable :math:`B(x)` function
to handle the boundary condition :math:`u(1)=D` is :math:`B(x)=Dx`.
The variational formulation becomes


.. math::
         (u',v') = (2,v) - Cv(0)\quad\forall v\in V\thinspace .

The entries in the linear system are then


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} &= ({\varphi}_j,{\varphi}_i) = \int_{0}^1 {\varphi}_i'(x){\varphi}_j'(x)dx
        = \int_0^1 (i+1)(j+1)(1-x)^{i+j}dx,\\
        b_i &= (2,{\varphi}_i) - (D,{\varphi}_i') -C{\varphi}_i(0)\\
        &= \int_0^1\left( 2{\varphi}_i(x) - D{\varphi}_i'(x)\right)dx -C{\varphi}_i(0)\\
        &= \int_0^1 \left( 2(1-x)^{i+1} - D(i+1)(1-x)^i\right)dx  -C{\varphi}_i(0)
        \thinspace .
        

With :math:`N=1` we can calculate
the global matrix system to be


.. math::
        
        \left(\begin{array}{cc}
        1 & 1\\
        1 & 4/3
        \end{array}\right)
        \left(\begin{array}{c}
        c_0\\
        c_1
        \end{array}\right)
        =
        \left(\begin{array}{c}
        -C+D+1\\
        2/3 -C + D
        \end{array}\right)
        

The solution becomes :math:`c_0=-C+D+2` and :math:`c_1=-1`, resulting in


.. math::
        
        u(x) = 1 -x^2 + D + C(x-1),
        


The exact solution is easily obtained by
integrating twice and applying the boundary conditions:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> from sympy import *
        >>> x, C, D = symbols('x C D')
        >>> f = 2
        >>> f1 = integrate(f, x)
        >>> f2 = integrate(f1, x)
        >>> C1, C2 = symbols('C1 C2')       # integration constants
        >>> u = -f2 + C1*x + C2

We observe that the numerical solution coincides with the exact one, which
is to be expected since the expansion for :math:`u` contains the
exact solution as special case.


.. _fem:deq:1D:optimization:

Variational problems and optimization of functionals
----------------------------------------------------

If :math:`a(u,v)=a(v,u)`, it can be shown that the variational statement
:math:`a(u,v)=L(v)\quad\forall v\in V` is equivalent to minimizing the functional


.. math::
         F(v) = \frac{1}{2}a(v,v) - L(v) 

over all functions :math:`v\in V`. That is,

.. math::
         F(u)\leq F(v)\quad \forall v\in V\thinspace .

Inserting a :math:`v=\sum_j c_j{\varphi}_j` turns minimization of :math:`F(v)` into
minimization of a quadratic function


.. math::
         \bar F(c_0,\ldots,c_N) = \sum_{j=0}^N\sum_{i=0}^N a({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j)c_ic_j - \sum_{j=0}^N L({\varphi}_j)c_j
        

of :math:`N+1` parameters.

Many traditional applications of the finite element method, especially
in solid mechanics and structural analysis, start with formulating :math:`F(v)`
from physical principles, such as minimization of energy, and then
proceeds with deriving :math:`a(u,v)=L(v)`, which is the equation usually desired
in implementations.


.. _fem:deq:1D:fem1:

Computing with finite elements
==============================

The purpose of this section is to demonstrate in detail how
the finite element method can the be applied to the model problem


.. math::
         -u''(x) = 2,\quad x\in (0,L),\ u(0)=u(L)=0,

with variational formulation


.. math::
         (u',v') = (2,v)\quad\forall v\in V\thinspace . 

The variational formulation is derived in :eq:`fem:deq:1D:intbyparts`.

Since :math:`u` is known to be zero
at the end points of the interval, we can utilize a sum over
the basis functions associated with internal nodes only:


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:fem1:ex:u
        
        u(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{N-1}c_j{\varphi}_j(x)\thinspace .
        
        

Observe that :math:`u(0)` and :math:`u(L)` are zero since
:math:`{\varphi}_0` and :math:`{\varphi}_N` are left out of the sum: the remaining
:math:`{\varphi}_i` are all zero at :math:`x=0` and :math:`x=L`. This means that
only :math:`c_1,\ldots,c_{N-1}` are unknowns and the variational
statement in :eq:`fem:deq:1D:intbyparts` holds only for
:math:`i=1,\ldots,N-1`.
For simplicity, we introduce uniformly spaced nodes, numbered from left
to right:


.. math::
         x_{i} = i h,\quad h=L/N,\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace . 

The simplest choice of elements is P1 elements with piecewise
linear functions. The nodes then coincides with the cell vertices and
:math:`\Omega^{(e)}=[x_{e}, x_{e+1}]`.

.. _fem:deq:1D:comp:global:

Computation in the global physical domain
-----------------------------------------


We shall first perform a computation in the :math:`x`
coordinate system because the integrals can be easily computed
here by simple, visual,
geometric considerations. This is called a global approach
since we work in the :math:`x` coordinate system and compute integrals on
the global domain :math:`[0,L]`.

The entries in the coefficient matrix and right-hand side are


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j}=\int_0^L{\varphi}_i'(x){\varphi}_j'(x) dx,\quad
        b_i=\int_0^L2{\varphi}_i(x) dx
        \thinspace . 

The :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` function
is specified in
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2`.
However,
we need the derivative of :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` to compute the coefficient matrix.
These are


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:Dphi:1:formula2
        
        {\varphi}_i'(x) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        0, & x < x_{i-1},\\
        h^{-1},
        & x_{i-1} \leq x < x_{i},\\
        -h^{-1},
        & x_{i} \leq x < x_{i+1},\\
        0, & x\geq x_{i+1}
        \end{array}
        \right.
        
        

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:dP1` shows :math:`{\varphi}_1'(X)` and :math:`{\varphi}_2'(X)`.

   *Illustration of the derivative of piecewise linear basis functions associated with nodes in cell 1*


We realize that :math:`{\varphi}_i'` and :math:`{\varphi}_j'` has no overlap, and hence their
product vanishes, unless :math:`i` and :math:`j` are nodes belonging to the same
element. The only nonzero contributions to the coefficient matrix are
therefore


.. math::
        
        A_{i-1,i} &=\int_0^L{\varphi}_{i-1}'(x){\varphi}_i'(x) dx,\\
        A_{i,i}&=\int_0^L{\varphi}_{i}'(x)^2 dx, \\
        A_{i,i+1}&=\int_0^L{\varphi}_{i}'(x){\varphi}_{i+1}'(x) dx,
        

for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N-1` (recall that we in :eq:`fem:deq:1D:fem1:ex:u`
have excluded the end nodes
because of the boundary conditions).

We see that :math:`{\varphi}_{i-1}'(x)` and :math:`{\varphi}_i'(x)` have overlap of one
cell :math:`\Omega^{(i-1)}=[x_{i-1},x_{i}]` and that their product
then is :math:`-1/h^{2}`. The integrand is constant and therefore
:math:`A_{i-1,i}=-h^{-2}h=-h^{-1}`.
A similar reasoning can be applied to
:math:`A_{i+1,i}`, which also becomes :math:`-h^{-1}`. The integral of
:math:`{\varphi}_i'(x)^2` gets contributions from two cells,
:math:`\Omega^{(i-1)}=[x_{i-1},x_{i}]` and
:math:`\Omega^{(i)}=[x_{i},x_{i+1}]`, but :math:`{\varphi}_i'(x)^2=h^{-2}` in
both cells, and the length of the integration interval is :math:`2h` so
we get
:math:`A_{i,i}=2h^{-1}`. The right-hand side involves an integral of :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)`,
:math:`i=1,\ldots,N-1`,
which is just the area under a hat function of height 1 and width
:math:`2h`, i.e., equal to :math:`h`. Hence, :math:`b_i=2h`.

.. The integrals over the first and last element give slightly different

.. results: :math:`A_{0,0}=h^{-1}` and :math:`A_{N,N}=h^{-1}` since the integration

.. interval has length :math:`h`. Similarly, :math:`b_0=b_N=h`. The entries

.. :math:`A_{0,1}` and :math:`A_{N-1,N` are calculated in the same way as explained

.. above and are therefore :math:`-1/h`.


Note that there are no entries :math:`A_{0,0}` and :math:`A_{N,N}`
since :math:`c_0` and :math:`c_N` are left out of the matrix system.
The equation system to be solved only involves the unknowns :math:`c_1,\ldots,c_{N-1}`,
the right-hand side coefficients :math:`b_1,\ldots,b_{N-1}`, and
the matrix entries :math:`A_{1,1}`, :math:`A_{1,2}`, :math:`A_{2,1}`, :math:`A_{2,2}`, :math:`\ldots`,
:math:`A_{N-1,N-1}`, and :math:`A_{N-1,N-1}`. We can collect these numbers in
a matrix system that takes the following form:

.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:glob
        
        \frac{1}{h}\left(
        \begin{array}{ccccccccc}
        2 & -1 & 0
        &\cdots &
        \cdots & \cdots & \cdots &
        \cdots & 0 \\
        -1 & 2 & -1 & \ddots &   & &  & &  \vdots \\
        0 & -1 & 2 & -1 &
        \ddots & &  &  & \vdots \\
        \vdots & \ddots &  & \ddots & \ddots & 0 &  & & \vdots \\
        \vdots &  & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & & \vdots \\
        \vdots & &  & 0 & -1 & 2 & -1 & \ddots & \vdots \\
        \vdots & & &  & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots &\ddots  & 0 \\
        \vdots & & & &  &\ddots  & \ddots &\ddots  & -1 \\
        0 &\cdots & \cdots &\cdots & \cdots & \cdots  & 0 & -1 & 2
        \end{array}
        \right)
        \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
        c_1 \\
        \vdots\\
        \vdots\\
        \vdots \\
        \vdots \\
        \vdots \\
        \vdots \\
        \vdots\\
        c_{N-1}
        \end{array}
        \right)
        =
        \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
        2h \\
        \vdots\\
        \vdots\\
        \vdots \\
        \vdots \\
        \vdots \\
        \vdots \\
        \vdots\\
        2h
        \end{array}
        \right)
        
        


Since we know that :math:`c_j` equals :math:`u(x_{j})`, we can introduce the
notation :math:`u_j` for the value of :math:`u` at node :math:`j`. The
:math:`i`-th equation in this system is then


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:fem:ex1
        
        -\frac{1}{h}u_{i-1} + \frac{2}{h}u_{i} - \frac{1}{h}u_{i+1} = 2h\thinspace .
        
        


A finite difference discretization of :math:`-u''(x)=2` by a centered,
second-order finite difference approximation :math:`u''(x_i)\approx [D_x D_x u]_i`
with :math:`\Delta x = h`
yields


.. math::
        
        -\frac{u_{i-1} - 2u_{i} + u_{i+1}}{h^2} = 2,
        

which is, in fact, equivalent to :eq:`fem:deq:1D:fem:ex1` if
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:fem:ex1` is divided by :math:`h`.
Therefore, the finite difference and the finite element method are
equivalent in this simple test problem. Sometimes a finite element method
generates the finite difference equations on a uniform mesh, and sometimes
the finite element method generates equations that are different.
The differences are modest, but may influence the numerical quality of
the solution significantly, especially in time-dependent problems.
.. There will be many examples illustrating this point.


.. _fem:deq:1D:comp:elmwise:

Elementwise computations  (2)
-----------------------------

We now employ the element by element (or cell by cell)
computational procedure as
explained in
the sections :ref:`fem:approx:fe:elementwise`, :ref:`fem:approx:fe:mapping`,
and :ref:`fem:approx:fe:intg:ref`.
All integrals need to be mapped to the local reference coordinate system
(:math:`X`) according to the section :ref:`fem:approx:fe:mapping`.
In the present case, the matrix entries contain derivatives
with respect to :math:`x`,


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j}^{(e)}=\int_{\Omega^{(e)}} {\varphi}_i'(x){\varphi}_j'(x) dx
        = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{d}{dx}{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)\frac{d}{dx}{\tilde{\varphi}}_s(X)
        \frac{h}{2} dX,
        

where the global degree of freedom :math:`i` is related to the local
degree of freedom :math:`r` through :math:`i=q(e,r)`. Similarly,
:math:`j=q(e,s)`. The local degrees of freedom run as :math:`r,s=0,1` for a P1
element.

There are simple formulas for the basis functions :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)` as
functions of :math:`X`.
However, we now
need to find the derivative of :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)` with respect to :math:`x`.
Given


.. math::
         {\tilde{\varphi}}_0(X)=\frac{1}{2}(1-X),\quad{\tilde{\varphi}}_1(X)=\frac{1}{2}(1+X),

we can easily compute :math:`d{\tilde{\varphi}}_r/ dX`:


.. math::
        \frac{d{\tilde{\varphi}}_0}{dX} = -\frac{1}{2},\quad  \frac{d{\tilde{\varphi}}_1}{dX} = \frac{1}{2}\thinspace . 

From the chain rule,


.. math::
        
        \frac{d{\tilde{\varphi}}_r}{dx} = \frac{d{\tilde{\varphi}}_r}{dX}\frac{dX}{dx}
        = \frac{2}{h}\frac{d{\tilde{\varphi}}_r}{dX}\thinspace . 

The transformed integral is then


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j}^{(e)}=\int_{\Omega^{(e)}} {\varphi}_i'(x){\varphi}_j'(x) dx
        = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{2}{h}\frac{d{\tilde{\varphi}}_r}{dX}\frac{2}{h}\frac{d{\tilde{\varphi}}_s}{dX}
        \frac{h}{2} dX
        \thinspace .
        

The right-hand side is transformed according to


.. math::
         b_i^{(e)} = \int_{\Omega^{(e)}} 2{\varphi}_i(x) dx =
        \int_{-1}^12{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)\frac{h}{2} dX,\quad i=q(e,r),\ r=0,1
        \thinspace .
        

Specifically for P1 elements we arrive at the following calculations for
the element matrix entries:


.. math::
        
        \tilde A_{0,0}^{(e)} &= \int_{-1}^1\frac{2}{h}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)
        \frac{2}{h}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{2}{h} dX = \frac{1}{h}\\
        \tilde A_{0,1}^{(e)} &= \int_{-1}^1\frac{2}{h}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)
        \frac{2}{h}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{2}{h} dX = -\frac{1}{h}\\
        \tilde A_{1,0}^{(e)} &= \int_{-1}^1\frac{2}{h}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
        \frac{2}{h}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{2}{h} dX = -\frac{1}{h}\\
        \tilde A_{1,1}^{(e)} &= \int_{-1}^1\frac{2}{h}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
        \frac{2}{h}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{2}{h} dX = \frac{1}{h}
        

The element vector entries become

.. math::
        
        \tilde b_0^{(e)} &= \int_{-1}^12\frac{1}{2}(1-X)\frac{h}{2} dX = h\\
        \tilde b_1^{(e)} &= \int_{-1}^12\frac{1}{2}(1+X)\frac{h}{2} dX = h\thinspace .
        

Expressing these entries in matrix and vector notation, we have


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:elm
        
        \tilde A^{(e)} =\frac{1}{h}\left(\begin{array}{rr}
        1 & -1\\
        -1 & 1
        \end{array}\right),\quad
        \tilde b^{(e)} = h\left(\begin{array}{c}
        1\\
        1
        \end{array}\right)\thinspace .
        
        


The next step is to assemble the contributions from the various elements.
Since only the unknowns :math:`c_1,\ldots,c_{N-1}` enter the linear system,
we assembly only :math:`\tilde A^{(0)}_{1,1}` and :math:`\tilde A^{(N-1)}_{0,0}` from the
first and last element, respectively. The result becomes
identical to :eq:`fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:glob`, which is not surprising since
the procedures are mathematically equivalent.

A fundamental problem with the matrix system we have assembled is that
the boundary conditions are not incorporated if :math:`D\neq 0`.
The next sections deals with this issue.


.. _fem:deq:1D:essBC:

Boundary conditions: specified value
====================================

We have to take special actions to incorporate Dirichlet conditions,
such as :math:`u(L)=D`,
into the computational procedures. The present section outlines
alternative, but mathematically equivalent, methods.


.. _fem:deq:1D:fem:essBC:Bfunc:

General construction of a boundary function
-------------------------------------------

In the section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:essBC:Bfunc` we introduce a boundary function :math:`B(x)`
to deal with nonzero Dirichlet boundary conditions for :math:`u`. The
construction of such a function is not always trivial, especially not
in multiple dimensions. However, a simple and general construction
idea exists when the
basis functions have the property


.. math::
        
        {\varphi}_i(x_{j}) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        1, & i=j,\\
        0, & i\neq j,
        \end{array}\right.
        

where :math:`x_{j}` is a boundary point. Examples on such
functions are the Lagrange interpolating polynomials and finite
element functions. With :math:`\Omega = [0,L]`, :math:`u(0)=U_0`,
and :math:`u(L)=U_N` we can then let


.. math::
        
        B(x) = U_0{\varphi}_0(x) + U_N{\varphi}_N(x)\thinspace . 

Since :math:`{\varphi}_0(x_0=0)=1` and :math:`{\varphi}_N(x_0=0)=0`, we have :math:`B(0)=U_0`.
Similarly, since
:math:`{\varphi}_0(x_N=L)=0` and :math:`{\varphi}_N(x_N=L)=1`, we have :math:`B(L)=U_N`.

In fact, the construction of :math:`B(x)` identifies :math:`c_0=U_0` and :math:`c_N=U_N`.
The remaining parameters :math:`c_1,\ldots,c_{N-1}` therefore the unknowns in
the linear system.
For the unknown :math:`u(x)` we then let the expansion be


.. math::
        
        u(x) = U_0{\varphi}_0(x) + U_N{\varphi}_N(x) + \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} c_j{\varphi}_j(x)\thinspace . 

In the case where
:math:`u` has a Dirichlet boundary condition at only one boundary point,
:math:`B(x)` contains just the term corresponding to that point and
the sum :math:`\sum_j c_j {\varphi}_j` runs over the rest of the points.
This construction of :math:`B` can easily be generalized to two- and three-dimensional
problems for which the construction is particularly powerful, because it
allows us :math:`u` to easily fulfill boundary values on a boundary of any geometrical
complexity.

Example  (3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us see how our previous model problem :math:`-u''=2`, :math:`u(0)=0`, :math:`u(L)=D`,
is affected by a :math:`B(x)` to incorporate boundary values.
The expansion for :math:`u(x)` reads


.. math::
        
        u(x) = 0\cdot{\varphi}_0(x) + D{\varphi}_N(x) +
        \sum_{j=1}^{N-1} c_j{\varphi}_j(x)
        \thinspace .
        

Inserting this expression in :math:`-(u'',{\varphi}_i)=(f,{\varphi}_i)` and
integrating by parts results in a linear system with


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} = \int_0^L {\varphi}_i'(x){\varphi}_j'(x) dx,\quad
        b_i = \int_0^L (f(x) - D{\varphi}_N'(x)){\varphi}_i(x) dx,
        

for :math:`i,j = 1,\ldots,N-1`.
The integral :math:`D\int_0^L {\varphi}_N'(x)){\varphi}_i(x) dx` can only get
a nonzero contribution from the last cell, :math:`\Omega^{(N-1)}=[x_{N-1},x_{N}]`
since :math:`{\varphi}_N(x)=0` on all other cells. Moreover,
:math:`{\varphi}_N'(x){\varphi}_i(x) dx \neq 0` only for :math:`i=N-1` and :math:`i=N`, but the latter
value is not included anymore. From the explanations of the
calculations in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:linearsystem` we find that
:math:`\int_0^L {\varphi}_N(x)){\varphi}_{N-1}(x) dx` must equal :math:`h/6`, resulting
in the need to add :math:`-D h/6` to :math:`b_{N-1}`.

As an alternative,
we now turn to *elementwise computations* and realize that :math:`B(x)=D{\varphi}_{N}=0`
on all cells except the last one. On the last cell we regard
the local degree of freedom :math:`c_1` as known (:math:`c_1=D`). There is only one unknown
in a P1 element and the element matrix is therefore a :math:`1\times 1` matrix.
We have :math:`\tilde A_{0,0}^{(N-1)} = 1/h` as in the other elements, while


.. math::
        
        \tilde b_0^{(N-1)} = \int_{-1}^1 (f - D{\tilde{\varphi}}_1){\tilde{\varphi}}_0\frac{h}{2}
        = h - D h/6
        \thinspace .
        

When assembling these contributions, we see that :math:`b_{N-1}` gets an
extra term :math:`-D h/6`, as in the computations in the physical domain.


.. _fem:deq:1D:fem:essBC:Bfunc:modsys:

Modification of the linear system
---------------------------------

From an implementational point of view, there is a convenient alternative
to adding the :math:`B(x)` function and considering only the :math:`c_i` coefficients
corresponding to nodes without Dirichlet conditions as unknowns.
Since Dirichlet values of :math:`u` basically means that we know the
corresponding :math:`c_i` values, we may assemble the entire linear system for
all degrees of freedom, without taking Dirichlet conditions into account,
and then modify the linear system such that the :math:`c_i` values corresponding
to Dirichlet conditions get their right values.

Consider the computation of the global coefficient matrix
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:glob`. If we include all the :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`
values in the system, we have some additional matrix entries
from the first and last cell. We start with


.. math::
         A_{0,0}=\int_0^L \left(\frac{d{\varphi}_0}{dx}\right)^2 dx = \frac{1}{h},

because the interval of integration, with nonzero contributions,
is just the first cell (and not two
cells as for the other :math:`A_{i,j}` associated with cells not touching the
boundaries). Similarly, in the last cell we get :math:`A_{N,N}=1/h`.
Furthermore, :math:`A_{0,1}=\int_0^L{\varphi}_0{\varphi}_1' dx=-1/h`.
A similar reasoning is used for
:math:`A_{N-1,N}=\int_0^L{\varphi}_{N-1}{\varphi}_{N}' dx=-1/h`.

Regarding the right-hand side, we must include :math:`b_0` and :math:`b_N`.
Because :math:`{\varphi}_0=0` on all cells except the first one and
:math:`{\varphi}_N=0` on all cells except the last one, :math:`b_0` and :math:`b_N` only involves
integration over the first and last element, respectively:


.. math::
        
        b_0 &= \int_0^L 2{\varphi}_0(x) dx = h,\\
        b_N &= \int_0^L 2{\varphi}_N(x) dx = h
        \thinspace .
        



The complete matrix system, involving all degrees of freedom, takes the form


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:glob2
        
        \frac{1}{h}\left(
        \begin{array}{ccccccccc}

        \cdots & 0 \\

The idea now is that we replace the first and last equation by the
equations :math:`c_0=0` and :math:`c_N=D`, which guarantees that the boundary
values of :math:`u` becomes correct. This action changes the system to

Symmetric modification of the linear system
-------------------------------------------

The original matrix system :eq:`fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:glob` is symmetric,
but the modifications in :eq:`fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:glob3` destroy
the symmetry. Our described modification will in general destroy an
initial symmetry in the matrix system. This is not a particular
computational disadvantage for tridiagonal systems arising in 1D
problems, but may be more serious in 2D and 3D when the systems are
large and exploiting symmetry can be very important for the solution method.
Therefore, a modification that preserves symmetry is frequently applied.

Let :math:`c_k` be a coefficient corresponding to a known value :math:`K`.
We want to replace equation :math:`k` in the system by :math:`c_k=K`, i.e.,
insert zeroes in row number :math:`k` in the coefficient matrix,
set 1 on the diagonal, and replace :math:`b_k` by :math:`K`.
A symmetry-preserving modification consists in first
subtracting column number :math:`k` in the coefficient matrix, i.e., :math:`A_{i,k}`
for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`, times the boundary value :math:`K`, from the
right-hand side: :math:`b_i \leftarrow b_i - A_{i,k}K`. Then we put
zeroes in row number :math:`k` *and* column number :math:`k` in the coefficient matrix,
and finally set :math:`b_k=K`. The steps in algorithmic form becomes

 1. :math:`b_i \leftarrow b_i - A_{i,k}K` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`

 2. :math:`A_{i,k} = A_{k,i} = 0` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`

 3. :math:`A_{k,k}=1`

 4. :math:`b_i = K`

This modification goes as follows for the above system. First we
subtract the first column in the coefficient matrix, times the boundary
value, from the right-hand side. Because :math:`c_0=0`, this subtraction
has no effect. Then we subtract the last column, times the boundary value :math:`D`,
from the right-hand side. This action results in :math:`b_{N-1}=2h+D/h` and
:math:`b_N=h-2D/h`. Thereafter, we place zeros in the first and last row and
column in the coefficient matrix and 1 on the two corresponding diagonal
entries. Finally, we set :math:`b_0=0` and :math:`b_N=D`. The result becomes


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:glob3:symm
        
        \frac{1}{h}\left(
        \begin{array}{ccccccccc}
        1 & 0 & 0
        &\cdots &
        \cdots & \cdots & \cdots &
        \cdots & 0 \\
        0 & 2 & -1 & \ddots &   & &  & &  \vdots \\

        =
        \left(
        \begin{array}{c}
        0 \\
        2h\\

        \vdots \\
        2h +D/h\\
        D
        \end{array}
        \right)
        
        


Modification of the element matrix and vector
---------------------------------------------

The modifications of the global linear system can alternatively
be done for the element matrix and vector. (The assembled
system will get :math:`n` on the main diagonal if :math:`n` elements contribute
to the same unknown, but the factor :math:`n` will also appear on the
right-hand side and hence cancel out.)

We have, in the present computational example, the element matrix and vector
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:elm`. The modifications are needed in
cells where one of the degrees of freedom is known. Here, this means
the first and last cell. In the first cell, local degree of freedom number 0
is known and the modification becomes


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:elm:bc:0
        
        \tilde A^{(0)} =
        A = \frac{1}{h}\left(\begin{array}{rr}
        1 & 0\\
        -1 & 1
        \end{array}\right),\quad
        \tilde b^{(0)} = \left(\begin{array}{c}
        0\\
        h
        \end{array}\right)\thinspace .
        
        

In the last cell we set


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:elm:bc:N
        
        \tilde A^{(N-1)} =
        A = \frac{1}{h}\left(\begin{array}{rr}
        1 & -1\\
        0 & 1
        \end{array}\right),\quad
        \tilde b^{(N-1)} = \left(\begin{array}{c}
        h\\
        D
        \end{array}\right)\thinspace .
        
        


We can also perform the symmetric modification. This operation affects
only the last cell with a nonzero Dirichlet condition. The result
becomes


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:elm:bc:N:symm
        
        \tilde A^{(N-1)} =
        A = \frac{1}{h}\left(\begin{array}{rr}
        1 & 0\\
        0 & 1
        \end{array}\right),\quad
        \tilde b^{(N-1)} = \left(\begin{array}{c}
        h + D/h\\
        D
        \end{array}\right)\thinspace .
        
        

The reader should assemble the element matrices and vectors and
check that the result coincides with the system
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:glob3:symm`.

.. As a final remark, we repeat that Dirichlet conditions are referred

.. to as essential boundary conditions because they require

.. quite some work with modifying

.. either the linear system or the expansion formula

.. for :math:`u`. Boundary conditions for the derivative are much easier to

.. implement, as shown next, and therefore deserve the name *natural

.. boundary condition*.


.. _fem:deq:1D:BC:nat:

Boundary conditions: specified derivative
=========================================

Suppose our model problem :math:`-u''(x)=f(x)` features
the boundary conditions :math:`u'(0)=C` and :math:`u(L)=D`.
As already indicated in the section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:varform:ex`,
the former condition can be incorporated through the boundary term
that arises from integration by parts. This details of this method will now be
illustrated in the context of finite elements.

The variational formulation
---------------------------

Starting with the Galerkin method,


.. math::
         \int_0^L(u''(x)+f(x)){\varphi}_i(x) dx = 0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N,

integrating :math:`u''{\varphi}_i` by parts results in


.. math::
         \int_0^Lu'(x)'{\varphi}_i'(x) dx -(u'(L){\varphi}_i(L) - u'(0){\varphi}_i(0)) =
        \int_0^L f(x){\varphi}_i(x) dx, 

for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`.
The first boundary term vanishes since
:math:`{\varphi}_i(L)=0` when :math:`u(L)` is known.
Or, if we prefer to modify the linear system and include :math:`{\varphi}_N` in
the calculations (:math:`{\varphi}_N(L)=1\neq 0`), it appears that the
only nonzero term :math:`u'(L){\varphi}_N(L)` is erased on the right-hand side
when we set :math:`b_N=D`. With either approach to incorporating Dirichlet
conditions, the term :math:`u'(L){\varphi}_i(L)`
does not contribute to the final matrix system.

The second boundary
term, :math:`u'(0){\varphi}_i(0)`, can be used to implement the condition :math:`u'(0)=C`,
provided :math:`{\varphi}_i(0)\neq 0` for some :math:`i` (but with finite elements
we fortunately have :math:`{\varphi}_0(0)=1`).
The variational formulation then becomes


.. math::
         \int_0^Lu'(x){\varphi}_i'(x) dx + C{\varphi}_i(0) =
        \int_0^L f(x){\varphi}_i(x) dx,\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace . 

Inserting


.. math::
         u(x) = B(x) + \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} c_j{\varphi}_j(x),
        \quad B(x) = D{\varphi}_N(x),
        

.. \frac{x}{L}D

leads to the linear system


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:natBC
        
        \sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\left(
        \int_0^L {\varphi}_i'(x){\varphi}_j'(x) dx \right)c_j =
        \int_0^L\left(f(x){\varphi}_i(x) -D{\varphi}_N'(x){\varphi}_i(x)\right) dx
         - C{\varphi}_i(0),
        
        

for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N-1`.
Alternatively, we may just work with


.. math::
         u(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{N} c_j{\varphi}_j(x),
        

and modify the last equation to :math:`c_N=D` in the linear system.
The linear system to be assembled then corresponds to
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:natBC` with the :math:`D{\varphi}_N'` term removed, and
:math:`j=N` must be included in the summation. Similarly, the equation
corresponding to :math:`i=N` must be included:


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:natBC2
        
        \sum_{j=0}^{N}\left(
        \int_0^L {\varphi}_i'(x){\varphi}_j'(x) dx \right)c_j =
        \int_0^L\left(f(x){\varphi}_i(x)\right) dx
         - C{\varphi}_i(0),\quad i=0,\ldots,N
        \thinspace .
        
        



We now turn to actual computations with P1 finite elements.
The focus is on how the linear system and
the element matrices and vectors are modified by the
condition :math:`u'(0)=C`.

Direct computation of the global linear system
----------------------------------------------

Consider first the approach where Dirichlet conditions are incorporated
by a :math:`B(x)` function and leaving out the known degrees of freedom
from the linear system. The relevant formula for the linear
system is given by :eq:`fem:deq:1D:natBC`.
There are two differences compared to the extensively
computed case where :math:`u(0)=0`. Because we do not have a Dirichlet
condition at the left boundary, we need to extend the linear system
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:glob` with an equation corresponding to :math:`i=0`.
According to the section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:fem:essBC:Bfunc:modsys`, this
consists of including :math:`A_{0,0}=1/h`, :math:`A_{0,1}=-1/h`, and :math:`b_0=h`.
Second, we need to include
the extra term
:math:`-C{\varphi}_i(0)` on the right-hand side. Since all :math:`{\varphi}_i(0)=0`
for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N`, this term reduces to :math:`-C{\varphi}_0(0)=-C` and
affects only the first equation (:math:`i=0`). We simply add :math:`-C` to :math:`b_0`
such that :math:`b_0=h - C`.

Next we consider the technique where we modify the linear system to
incorporate Dirichlet conditions. The only difference from the
case in the section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:fem:essBC:Bfunc:modsys` is simply the
extra term :math:`-C` in the :math:`b_0` entry so we can just add this
value and continue with modifying the last equation to incorporate
:math:`c_N=D`.

Elementwise computations  (3)
-----------------------------

In the case we compute with one element at a time, we need to see how the
:math:`u'(0)=C` condition affects the element matrix and vector.
As above for the case of forming a global system directly,
the extra term :math:`-C{\varphi}_i(0)` in the variational formulation
only affects the element vector in the first element.
On the reference cell, :math:`-C{\varphi}_i(0)` is transformed to
:math:`-C{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(-1)`, where :math:`r` counts local degrees of freedom.
Only :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_0(-1)\neq 0` so we are left with the contribution
:math:`-C{\tilde{\varphi}}_0(-1)=-C` to :math:`\tilde b^{(0)}_0`:


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:ex1:Ab:elm:bc:nat
        
        \tilde A^{(0)} =
        A = \frac{1}{h}\left(\begin{array}{rr}
        1 & 1\\
        -1 & 1
        \end{array}\right),\quad
        \tilde b^{(0)} = \left(\begin{array}{c}
        h - C\\
        h
        \end{array}\right)\thinspace .
        
        

No other element matrices or vectors are affected.



.. _fem:deq:1D:code:global:

Implementation  (4)
===================

It is tempting to create a
program with symbolic calculations to perform all the steps in the
computational machinery,
both for automating the work and for documenting the complete algorithms.
As we have seen, there are quite many details involved with
finite element computations and incorporation of boundary conditions.
An implementation will also act as a structured summary of all these details.

Global basis functions  (2)
---------------------------

A function similar to ``least_squares`` from
the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:LS:code` can easily be made. However, in the
approximation problem the formulas for the entries in the
linear system are fixed, while when we solve a differential equation
the formulas are only known by the user of the function, since
the formulas must be derived by a Galerkin or least squares principle
and depend on the differential equation at hand.
We therefore require that the user prepares a function
``integrand_lhs(phi, i, j)`` for returning the integrand of the
integral that contributes to matrix entry :math:`(i,j)`.
The ``phi`` variable is a Python dictionary holding the basis
functions and their derivatives in symbolic form. That is,
``phi[q]`` is a list of


.. math::
        
        \{\frac{d^q{\varphi}_0}{dx^q},\ldots,\frac{d^q{\varphi}_N}{dx^q}\}
        \thinspace .
        

Similarly, ``integrand_rhs(phi, i)`` returns the integrand
for cell :math:`i` in the right-hand side vector.
Since we also have contributions to this vector (and potentially also the
matrix) from boundary terms without any integral, we introduce two
additional functions, ``boundary_lhs(phi, i, j)`` and
``boundary_rhs(phi, i)`` for returning terms in the variational
formulation that are not to be integrated over the domain :math:`\Omega`.

The linear system can now be computed and solved symbolically by
the following function:


.. code-block:: python

        def solve(integrand_lhs, integrand_rhs, phi, Omega,
                  boundary_lhs=None, boundary_rhs=None):
            N = len(phi[0]) - 1
            A = sm.zeros((N+1, N+1))
            b = sm.zeros((N+1, 1))
            x = sm.Symbol('x')
            for i in range(N+1):
                for j in range(i, N+1):
                    integrand = integrand_lhs(phi, i, j)
                    I = sm.integrate(integrand, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                    if boundary_lhs is not None:
                        I += boundary_lhs(phi, i, j)
                    A[i,j] = A[j,i] = I   # assume symmetry
                integrand = integrand_rhs(phi, i)
                I = sm.integrate(integrand, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                if boundary_rhs is not None:
                    I += boundary_rhs(phi, i)
                b[i,0] = I
            c = A.LUsolve(b)
            u = sum(c[i,0]*phi[0][i] for i in range(len(phi[0])))
            return u


It turns out that symbolic solution of differential
equations, discretized by a Galerkin or least squares method
with global basis functions,
is of limited interest beyond the simplest problems.
Symbolic integration might be very time consuming or impossible, not
only in ``sympy`` but also in
`WolframAlpha <http://wolframalpha.com>`_
(which applies the perhaps most powerful symbolic integration
software available today: Mathematica). Numerical integration
as an option is therefore desirable.

The extended ``solve`` function below tries to combine symbolic and
numerical integration.  The latter can be enforced by the user, or it
can be invoked after a non-successful symbolic integration (being
detected by an ``Integral`` object as the result of the integration, see
also the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange`). Note that for a
numerical integration, symbolic expressions must be converted to
Python functions (using ``lambdify``), and the expressions cannot contain
other symbols than ``x``. The real ``solve`` routine in the
`varform1D.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/fem/varform1D.py>`_
file has error checking and meaningful error messages in such cases.
The ``solve`` code below is a condensed version of the real one, with
the purpose of showing how to automate the Galerkin or least squares
method for solving differential equations in 1D with global basis functions:


.. code-block:: python

        def solve(integrand_lhs, integrand_rhs, phi, Omega,
                  boundary_lhs=None, boundary_rhs=None, numint=False):
            N = len(phi[0]) - 1
            A = sm.zeros((N+1, N+1))
            b = sm.zeros((N+1, 1))
            x = sm.Symbol('x')
            for i in range(N+1):
                for j in range(i, N+1):
                    integrand = integrand_lhs(phi, i, j)
                    if not numint:
                        I = sm.integrate(integrand, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                        if isinstance(I, sm.Integral):
                            numint = True  # force num.int. hereafter
                    if numint:
                        integrand = sm.lambdify([x], integrand)
                        I = sm.mpmath.quad(integrand, [Omega[0], Omega[1]])
                    if boundary_lhs is not None:
                        I += boundary_lhs(phi, i, j)
                    A[i,j] = A[j,i] = I
                integrand = integrand_rhs(phi, i)
                if not numint:
                    I = sm.integrate(integrand, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                    if isinstance(I, sm.Integral):
                        numint = True
                if numint:
                    integrand = sm.lambdify([x], integrand)
                    I = sm.mpmath.quad(integrand, [Omega[0], Omega[1]])
                if boundary_rhs is not None:
                    I += boundary_rhs(phi, i)
                b[i,0] = I
            c = A.LUsolve(b)
            u = sum(c[i,0]*phi[0][i] for i in range(len(phi[0])))
            return u


Example: constant right-hand side
---------------------------------

To demonstrate the code above, we address


.. math::
         -u''(x)=b,\quad x\in\Omega=[0,1],\quad u(0)=1,\ u(1)=0,

with :math:`b` as a (symbolic) constant. A possible choice of space :math:`V`,
where the basis functions satisfy
the requirements :math:`{\varphi}_i(0)={\varphi}_i(1)=0`, is


.. math::
         V = \hbox{span}\,\{{\varphi}_i(x) = x^{i+1}(1-x)\}_{i=0}^N\thinspace .

We also need a :math:`B(x)` function to take care of the known boundary
values of :math:`u`. Any function :math:`B(x)=1-x^p`, :math:`p\in\mathbb{R}`, is a candidate.
One arbitrary choice from this family
is :math:`B(x)=1-x^3`. The unknown function is then written as
a sum of a known (:math:`B`) and an unknown (:math:`\bar u`) function:


.. math::
         u(x) = B(x) + \bar u (x),\quad \bar u(x) = \sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j(x)\thinspace . 


Let us use the Galerkin method to derive the variational formulation.
Multiplying the differential
equation by :math:`v` and integrate by parts yield


.. math::
        
        \int_0^1 u'v' dx = \int_0^1 fv dx\quad\forall v\in V,
        

and with :math:`u=B + \bar u`,


.. math::
        
        \int_0^1 \bar u'v' dx = \int_0^1 (f-B')v dx\quad\forall v\in V\thinspace . 

Inserting :math:`\bar u = \sum_{j}c_j{\varphi}_j`, we get the linear system


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^N\left(\int_0^1{\varphi}_i'{\varphi}_j' dx\right)c_j = \int_0^1(f-B'){\varphi}_i dx,
        \quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace . 



The application can be coded as follows in ``sympy``:


.. code-block:: python

        x, b = sm.symbols('x b')
        f = b
        B = 1 - x**3
        dBdx = sm.diff(B, x)
        
        # Compute basis functions and their derivatives
        N = 3
        phi = {0: [x**(i+1)*(1-x) for i in range(N+1)]}
        phi[1] = [sm.diff(phi_i, x) for phi_i in phi[0]]
        
        def integrand_lhs(phi, i, j):
            return phi[1][i]*phi[1][j]
        
        def integrand_rhs(phi, i):
            return f*phi[0][i] - dBdx*phi[1][i]
        
        Omega = [0, 1]
        
        u_bar = solve(integrand_lhs, integrand_rhs, phi, Omega,
                      verbose=True, numint=False)
        u = B + u_bar
        print 'solution u:', sm.simplify(sm.expand(u))

The printout of ``u`` reads ``-b*x**2/2 + b*x/2 - x + 1``.
Note that expanding ``u`` and then simplifying is in the present case
desirable to get a compact, final expression with ``sympy``.
A non-expanded ``u`` might be preferable in other cases - this depends on
the problem in question.

The exact solution :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}(x)` can be derived by the following
``sympy`` code:


.. code-block:: python

        # Solve -u''=f by integrating f twice
        f1 = sm.integrate(f, x)
        f2 = sm.integrate(f1, x)
        # Add integration constants
        C1, C2 = sm.symbols('C1 C2')
        u_e = -f2 + C1*x + C2
        # Find C1 and C2 from the boundary conditions u(0)=0, u(1)=1
        s = sm.solve([u_e.subs(x,0) - 1, u_e.subs(x,1) - 0], [C1, C2])
        # Form the exact solution
        u_e = -f2 + s[C1]*x + s[C2]
        print 'analytical solution:', u_e
        print 'error:', sm.expand(u - u_e)

The last line prints ``0``, which is not surprising when
:math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}(x)` is a parabola and our approximate :math:`u` contains polynomials up to
degree 4. It suffices to have :math:`N=1`, i.e., polynomials of degree
2, to recover the exact solution.

We can play around with the code and test that with :math:`f\sim x^p`,
the solution is a polynomial of degree :math:`p+2`, and :math:`N=p+1` guarantees
that the approximate solution is exact.

Although the symbolic code is capable of integrating many choices of :math:`f(x)`,
the symbolic expressions for :math:`u` quickly become lengthy and non-informative,
so numerical integration in the code, and hence numerical answers,
have the greatest application potential.

Finite elements
---------------

Implementation of the finite element algorithms for differential
equations follows closely the algorithm for approximation of functions.
The new additional ingredients are

1. other types of integrands (as implied by the variational formulation)

2. additional boundary terms in the variational formulation for
   Neumann boundary conditions

3. modification of element matrices and vectors due to Dirichlet
   boundary conditions

Point 1 and 2 can be taken care of by letting the user supply
functions defining the integrands and boundary terms on the
left- and right-hand side of the equation system:


.. code-block:: python

        integrand_lhs(phi, r, s, x)
        boundary_lhs(phi, r, s, x)
        integrand_rhs(phi, r, x)
        boundary_rhs(phi, r, x)

Here, ``phi`` is a dictionary where ``phi[q]`` holds a list of
the derivatives of order ``q`` of the basis functions at the
an evaluation point; ``r`` and ``s`` are indices for the corresponding
entries in the element matrix and vector, and ``x`` is the global
coordinate value corresponding to the current evaluation point.

Given a mesh represented by ``vertices``, ``cells``, and ``dof_map`` as
explained before, we can write a pseudo Python code to list all
the steps in the computational algorithm for finite element solution
of a differential equation.


.. code-block:: python

        <Declare global matrix and rhs: A, b>
        
        for e in range(len(cells)):
        
            # Compute element matrix and vector
            n = len(dof_map[e])  # no of dofs in this element
            h = vertices[cells[e][1]] - vertices[cells[e][1]]
            <Declare element matrix and vector: A_e, b_e>
        
            # Integrate over the reference cell
            points, weights = <numerical integration rule>
            for X, w in zip(points, weights):
                phi = <basis functions and derivatives at X>
                detJ = h/2
                x = <affine mapping from X>
                for r in range(n):
                    for s in range(n):
                        A_e[r,s] += integrand_lhs(phi, r, s, x)*detJ*w
                    b_e[r] += integrand_rhs(phi, r, x)*detJ*w
        
            # Add boundary terms
            for r in range(n):
                for s in range(n):
                    A_e[r,s] += boundary_lhs(phi, r, s, x)*detJ*w
                b_e[r] += boundary_rhs(phi, r, x)*detJ*w
        
            # Incorporate essential boundary conditions
            for r in range(n):
                global_dof = dof_map[e][r]
                if global_dof in essbc_dofs:
                    # dof r is subject to an essential condition
                    value = essbc_docs[global_dof]
                    # Symmetric modification
                    b_e -= value*A_e[:,r]
                    A_e[r,:] = 0
                    A_e[:,r] = 0
                    A_e[r,r] = 1
                    b_e[r] = value
        
            # Assemble
            for r in range(n):
                for s in range(n):
                    A[dof_map[e][r], dof_map[e][r]] += A_e[r,s]
                b[dof_map[e][r] += b_e[r]
        
        <solve linear system>


.. _fem:deq:2D:varform:

Variational formulations in 2D and 3D
=====================================

The major difference between deriving variational formulations in 2D and 3D
compared to 1D is the rule for integrating by parts.
A typical second-order term in a PDE may be written in dimension-independent
notation as


.. math::
         \nabla^2 u \quad\hbox{or}\quad \nabla\cdot\left( a(\pmb{x})\nabla u\right)
        \thinspace .
        

The explicit forms in a 2D problem become

.. math::
         \nabla^2 u = \nabla\cdot\nabla u =
        \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} +
        \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2},
        

and

.. math::
        
        \nabla\cdot\left( a(\pmb{x})\nabla u\right) =
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( a(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right) +
        \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( a(x,y)\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right)
        \thinspace .
        


The general rule for integrating by parts is


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:2D:int:by:parts
        
        -\int_{\Omega} \nabla\cdot (a(\pmb{x})\nabla u) v{\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        \int_{\Omega} a(\pmb{x})\nabla u\cdot\nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x} -
        \int_{\partial\Omega} a\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} v {\, \mathrm{d}s},
        
        

where :math:`\partial\Omega` is the boundary of :math:`\Omega` and
:math:`\partial u/\partial n = \pmb{n}\cdot\nabla u` is the derivative
of :math:`u` in the outward normal direction, :math:`\pmb{n}` being an outward
unit normal to :math:`\partial\Omega`. The integrals :math:`\int_\Omega (){\, \mathrm{d}x}` are
area integrals in 2D and volume integrals in 3D, while
:math:`\int_{\partial\Omega} (){\, \mathrm{d}s}` is a line integral in 2D and a surface
integral in 3D.

Note that :eq:`fem:deq:2D:int:by:parts` obviously applies to a constant
:math:`a`, which is what we have if the PDE has a Laplace term :math:`a\nabla^2 u`.

Let us divide the boundary into two parts:

 * :math:`\partial\Omega_N`, where we have Neumann conditions
   :math:`-a\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = g`, and

 * :math:`\partial\Omega_D`, where we have Dirichlet conditions
   :math:`u = u_0`.

The test functions :math:`v` are required to vanish on :math:`\partial\Omega_D`.

*Example.* Here is a quite general linear PDE arising in many problems:


.. math::
        
        \pmb{v}\cdot\nabla u + \alpha u &= \nabla\cdot\left( a\nabla u\right) + f,
        \quad\pmb{x}\in\Omega,\\
        u &= u_0,\quad\pmb{x}\in\partial\Omega_D,\\
        -a\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} &= g,\quad\pmb{x}\in\partial\Omega_N
        \thinspace .
        

The vector field :math:`\pmb{v}` and the scalar functions :math:`a`, :math:`\alpha`, :math:`f`, :math:`u_0`, and
:math:`g` may vary with the spatial coordinate :math:`\pmb{x}` and must be known.

Such a second-order PDE needs exactly one boundary condition at each
point of the boundary, so :math:`\partial\Omega_N\cup\partial\Omega_D`
must be the complete boundary :math:`\partial\Omega`.

The unknown function can be expanded as


.. math::
         u = u_0 + \sum_{j=0}^N c_j{\varphi}_j \thinspace .

The variational formula is obtained from Galerkin's method, which
technically implies multiplying the PDE by a test
function :math:`v` and integrating over :math:`\Omega`:


.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega} (\pmb{v}\cdot\nabla u + \alpha u)v{\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        \int_{\Omega} \nabla\cdot\left( a\nabla u\right){\, \mathrm{d}x} + \int_{\Omega}fv {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        \thinspace .
        

The second-order term is integrated by parts, according to


.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega} \nabla\cdot\left( a\nabla u\right)v {\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        -\int_{\Omega} a\nabla u\cdot\nabla v{\, \mathrm{d}x}
        + \int_{\partial\Omega} a\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} v{\, \mathrm{d}s}
        \thinspace .
        

The variational form now reads


.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega} (\pmb{v}\cdot\nabla u + \alpha u)v{\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        -\int_{\Omega} a\nabla u\cdot\nabla v{\, \mathrm{d}x}
        + \int_{\partial\Omega} a\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} v{\, \mathrm{d}s}
        + \int_{\Omega} fv {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        \thinspace .
        

The boundary term can be developed further by noticing that :math:`v\neq 0`
only on :math:`\partial\Omega_N`,


.. math::
         \int_{\partial\Omega} a\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} v{\, \mathrm{d}s}
        = \int_{\partial\Omega_N} a\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} v{\, \mathrm{d}s},
        

and that on :math:`\partial\Omega_N`, we have the condition
:math:`a\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=-g`, so the term becomes


.. math::
        
        -\int_{\partial\Omega_N} gv{\, \mathrm{d}s}\thinspace .
        

The variational form is then


.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega} (\pmb{v}\cdot\nabla u + \alpha u)v{\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        -\int_{\Omega} a\nabla u\cdot\nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        - \int_{\partial\Omega} g v{\, \mathrm{d}s}
        + \int_{\Omega} fv {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        \thinspace .
        


Instead of using the integral signs we may use the inner product
notation :math:`(\cdot,\cdot)`:


.. math::
        
        (\pmb{v}\cdot\nabla u, v) + (\alpha u,v) =
        - (a\nabla u,\nabla v) - (g,v)_{N} + (f,v)
        \thinspace .
        

The subscript :math:`{}_N` in :math:`(g,v)_{N}` is a notation for a line or surface
integral over :math:`\partial\Omega_N`.

Inserting the :math:`u` expansion results in


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^N ((\pmb{v}\cdot\nabla {\varphi}_j, {\varphi}_i) &+ (\alpha {\varphi}_j ,{\varphi}_i) + (a\nabla {\varphi}_j,\nabla {\varphi}_i))c_j = \\
        & (g,{\varphi}_i)_{N} + (f,{\varphi}_i) -
        (\pmb{v}\cdot\nabla u_0, {\varphi}_i) + (\alpha u_0 ,{\varphi}_i) +
        (a\nabla u_0,\nabla {\varphi}_i)
        \thinspace .
        

This is a linear system with matrix entries


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} = (\pmb{v}\cdot\nabla {\varphi}_j, {\varphi}_i) + (\alpha {\varphi}_j ,{\varphi}_i) + (a\nabla {\varphi}_j,\nabla {\varphi}_i)
        

and right-hand side entries


.. math::
        
        b_i = (g,{\varphi}_i)_{N} + (f,{\varphi}_i) -
        (\pmb{v}\cdot\nabla u_0, {\varphi}_i) + (\alpha u_0 ,{\varphi}_i) +
        (a\nabla u_0,\nabla {\varphi}_i),
        

for :math:`i,j=0,\ldots,N`.

In the finite element method, we usually express :math:`u_0` in terms of
basis functions and restrict :math:`i` and :math:`j` to run over the degrees of
freedom that are not prescribed as Dirichlet conditions.
However, we can also keep all the :math:`c_j`, :math:`j=0,\ldots,N`, as unknowns
drop the :math:`u_0` in the expansion for :math:`u`, and incorporate all the
known :math:`c_j` values in the linear system. This has been explained
in detail in the 1D case.

Transformation to a reference cell in 2D and 3D
-----------------------------------------------

We consider an integral of the type


.. math::
        
        \int_{{\Omega}^{(e)}} a(\pmb{x})\nabla{\varphi}_i\cdot\nabla{\varphi}_j{\, \mathrm{d}x}
        

in the physical domain.
Suppose we want to calculate this integral over a reference cell,
denoted by :math:`\tilde\Omega^r`, in a coordinate system with coordinates
:math:`\pmb{X} = (X_0, X_1)` (2D) or :math:`\pmb{X} = (X_0, X_1, X_2)` (3D).
The mapping between a point :math:`\pmb{X}` in the reference coordinate system  and
the corresponding point :math:`\pmb{x}` in the physical coordinate system is
given by a vector relation :math:`\pmb{x}(\pmb{X})`.
The corresponding Jacobian, :math:`J`, of this mapping has entries

.. math::
         J_{i,j}=\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_i}\thinspace .


The change of variables requires :math:`{\, \mathrm{d}x}` to be replaced by :math:`\det J{\, \mathrm{d}X}`.
The derivatives in the :math:`\nabla` operator in the variational form are
with respect to :math:`\pmb{x}`, which we may denote by :math:`\nabla_{\pmb{x}}`.
The :math:`{\varphi}_i(\pmb{x})` functions in the integral
are replaced by local basis functions :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(\pmb{X})` so
the integral features :math:`\nabla_{\pmb{x}}{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(\pmb{X})`. We readily have
:math:`\nabla_{\pmb{X}}{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(\pmb{X})` from formulas for the basis functions, but
the desired quantity :math:`\nabla_{\pmb{x}}{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(\pmb{X})` requires some efforts
to compute. All the details are now given.

Let :math:`i=q(e,r)` and consider two space dimensions. By the chain rule,


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial {\tilde{\varphi}}_r}{\partial X} =
        \frac{\partial {\varphi}_i}{\partial X} =
        \frac{\partial {\varphi}_i}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial X} +
        \frac{\partial {\varphi}_i}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial X},
        

and

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial {\tilde{\varphi}}_r}{\partial Y} =
        \frac{\partial {\varphi}_i}{\partial Y} =
        \frac{\partial {\varphi}_i}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial Y} +
        \frac{\partial {\varphi}_i}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial Y}
        \thinspace .
        

We can write this as a vector equation

.. math::
        
        \left[\begin{array}{c}
        \frac{\partial {\tilde{\varphi}}_r}{\partial X}\\
        \frac{\partial {\tilde{\varphi}}_r}{\partial Y}
        \end{array}\right]
        =
        \left[\begin{array}{cc}
        \frac{\partial x}{\partial X} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial X}\\
        \frac{\partial x}{\partial Y} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial Y}
        \end{array}\right]
        \left[\begin{array}{c}
        \frac{\partial {\varphi}_i}{\partial x}\\
        \frac{\partial {\varphi}_i}{\partial y}
        \end{array}\right]
        

Identifying

.. math::
         \nabla_{\pmb{X}}{\tilde{\varphi}}_r = \left[\begin{array}{c}
        \frac{\partial {\tilde{\varphi}}_r}{\partial X}\\
        \frac{\partial {\tilde{\varphi}}_r}{\partial Y}
        \end{array}\right],
        \quad
        J =
        \left[\begin{array}{cc}
        \frac{\partial x}{\partial X} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial X}\\
        \frac{\partial x}{\partial Y} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial Y}
        \end{array}\right],
        \quad
        \nabla_{\pmb{x}}{\varphi}_r =
        \left[\begin{array}{c}
        \frac{\partial {\varphi}_i}{\partial x}\\
        \frac{\partial {\varphi}_i}{\partial y}
        \end{array}\right],
        

we have the relation

.. math::
         \nabla_{\pmb{X}}{\tilde{\varphi}}_r = J\cdot\nabla_{\pmb{x}}{\varphi}_i,

which we can solve with respect to :math:`\nabla_{\pmb{x}}{\varphi}_i`:

.. math::
        
        \nabla_{\pmb{x}}{\varphi}_i = J^{-1}\cdot\nabla_{\pmb{X}}{\tilde{\varphi}}_r\thinspace .
        

This means that we have the following transformation of the
integral in the physical domain to its counterpart over the reference cell:


.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega}^{(e)} a(\pmb{x})\nabla_{\pmb{x}}{\varphi}_i\cdot\nabla_{\pmb{x}}{\varphi}_j{\, \mathrm{d}x}
        \int_{\tilde\Omega^r} a(\pmb{x}(\pmb{X}))(J^{-1}\cdot\nabla_{\pmb{X}}{\tilde{\varphi}}_r)\cdot
        (J^{-1}\cdot\nabla{\tilde{\varphi}}_s)\det J{\, \mathrm{d}X}
        


Numerical integration  (2)
--------------------------

Integrals are normally computed by numerical integration rules.
For multi-dimensional cells, various families of rules exist.
All of them are similar to what is shown in 1D:
:math:`\int fdx\approx \sum_jw_if(\pmb{x}_j)`, where :math:`w_j` are weights and
:math:`\pmb{x}_j` are corresponding points.

Convenient formulas for P1 elements in 2D
-----------------------------------------

We shall now provide some formulas for piecewise linear :math:`{\varphi}_i` functions
and their integrals *in the physical coordinate system*.
These formulas make it convenient to compute with P1 elements without
the need to work in the reference coordinate system and deal with mappings
and Jacobians.
A lot of computational and algorithmic details are hidden by this approach.

Let :math:`\Omega^{(e)}` be cell number :math:`e`, and let the three vertices
have global vertex numbers :math:`I`, :math:`J`, and :math:`K`.
The corresponding coordinates are
:math:`(x_{I},y_{I})`, :math:`(x_{J},y_{J})`, and :math:`(x_{K},y_{K})`.
The basis function :math:`{\varphi}_I` over :math:`\Omega^{(e)}` have the explicit
formula


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:2D:phi:I
        
        {\varphi}_I (x,y) = \frac{1}{2}\Delta \left( \alpha_I + \beta_Ix
        + \gamma_Iy\right),
        
        

where


.. math::
        
        \alpha_I &= x_{J}y_{K} - x_{K}y_{J},
        \\
        \beta_I &= y_{J} - y_{K},
        \\
        \gamma_I &= x_{K} - x_{J},
        \\
        2\Delta &= \det\left(\begin{array}{rrr}
        1 & x_{I} & y_{I} \\
        1 & x_{J} & y_{J} \\
        1 & x_{K} & y_{K} \end{array}\right)
        \thinspace .
        
        

The quantity :math:`\Delta` is the area of the cell.

The following formula is often convenient when computing element matrices
and vectors:


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:2D:phi:integral
        
        \int_{\Omega^{(e)}} {\varphi}_I^{p}{\varphi}_J^{q}{\varphi}_K^{r} dx dy =
        {p!q!r!\over (p+q+r+2)!}2\Delta
        
        \thinspace .
        

(Note that the :math:`q` in this formula is not to be mixed with the :math:`q(e,r)`
mapping of degrees of freedom.)

As an example, the element matrix entry
:math:`\int_{\Omega^{(e)}} {\varphi}_I{\varphi}_J{\, \mathrm{d}x}`
can be computed by setting
:math:`p=q=1` and :math:`r=0`, when :math:`I\neq J`, yielding :math:`\Delta/12`, and
:math:`p=2` and :math:`q=r=0`, when :math:`I=J`, resulting in :math:`\Delta/6`.
We collect these numbers in a local element matrix:


.. math::
        
        \frac{\Delta}{12}
        \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
        2 & 1 & 1\\
        1 & 2 & 1\\
        1 & 1 & 2
        \end{array}\right]
        


The common element matrix entry :math:`\int_{\Omega^{(e)}} \nabla{\varphi}_I\cdot\nabla{\varphi}_J{\, \mathrm{d}x}`, arising from a Laplace term :math:`\nabla^2u`, can also easily be
computed by the formulas above. We have


.. math::
         \nabla{\varphi}_I\cdot\nabla{\varphi}_J =
        \frac{\Delta^2}{4}(\beta_I\beta_J + \gamma_I\gamma_J) = \hbox{const},

so that the element matrix entry becomes
:math:`\frac{1}{4}\Delta^3(\beta_I\beta_J + \gamma_I\gamma_J)`.

From an implementational point of view, one will work with local vertex
numbers :math:`r=0,1,2`, parameterize the coefficients in the basis
functions by :math:`r`, and look up vertex coordinates through :math:`q(e,r)`.

Summary
=======

 * When approximating :math:`f` by :math:`u = \sum_j c_j{\varphi}_j`, the least squares
   method and the Galerkin/projection method give the same result.
   The interpolation/collocation method is simpler and yields different
   (mostly inferior) results.

 * Fourier series expansion can be viewed as a least squares or Galerkin
   approximation procedure with sine and cosine functions.

 * Basis functions should optimally be orthogonal or almost orthogonal,
   because this gives little round-off errors when solving the linear
   system, and the coefficient matrix becomes diagonal or sparse.

 * Finite element basis functions are *piecewise* polynomials, normally
   with discontinuous derivatives at the cell boundaries. The basis
   functions overlap very little, leading to stable numerics and sparse
   matrices.

 * To use the finite element method for differential equations, we use
   the Galerkin method or the method of weighted residuals
   to arrive at a variational form. Technically, the differential equation
   is multiplied by a test function and integrated over the domain.
   Second-order derivatives are integrated by parts to allow for typical finite
   element basis functions that have discontinuous derivatives.

 * The least squares method is not much used for finite element solution
   of differential equations of second order, because
   it then involves second-order derivatives which cause trouble for
   basis functions with discontinuous derivatives.

 * We have worked with two common finite element terminologies and
   associated data structures
   (both are much used, especially the first one, while the other is more
   general):

    1. *elements*, *nodes*, and *mapping between local and global
       node numbers*

    2. an extended element concept consisting of *cell*, *vertices*,
       *degrees of freedom*, *local basis functions*,
       *geometry mapping*, and *mapping between
       local and global degrees of freedom*


 * The meaning of the word "element" is multi-fold: the geometry of a finite
   element (also known as a cell), the geometry and its basis functions,
   or all information listed under point 2 above.

 * One normally computes integrals in the finite element method element
   by element (cell by cell), either in a local reference coordinate
   system or directly in the physical domain.

 * The advantage of working in the reference coordinate system is that
   the mathematical expressions for the basis functions depend on the
   element type only, not the geometry of that element in the physical
   domain.  The disadvantage is that a mapping must be used, and
   derivatives must be transformed from reference to physical
   coordinates.

 * Element contributions to the global linear system are collected in
   an element matrix and vector, which must be assembled into the
   global system using the degree of freedom mapping (``dof_map``) or
   the node numbering mapping (``elements``), depending on which terminology
   that is used.

 * Dirichlet conditions, involving prescribed values of :math:`u` at the
   boundary, are implemented either via a boundary function that take
   on the right Dirichlet values, while the basis functions vanish at
   such boundaries. In the finite element method, one has a general
   expression for the boundary function, but one can also incorporate
   Dirichlet conditions in the element matrix and vector or in the
   global matrix system.

 * Neumann conditions, involving prescribed values of the derivative
   (or flux) of :math:`u`, are incorporated in boundary terms arising from
   integrating terms with second-order derivatives by part.
   Forgetting to account for the boundary terms implies the
   condition :math:`\partial u/\partial n=0` at parts of the boundary where
   no Dirichlet condition is set.

Time-dependent problems
=======================

The finite element method is normally used for discretization and
space. There are two alternative strategies for performing
a discretization in the time:

 * use finite differences for time derivatives to arrive at
   a recursive set of spatial problems that can be discretized by
   the finite element method, or

 * discretize in space by finite elements first, and then solve
   the resulting system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by
   some standard method for ODEs.

We shall exemplify these strategies using a simple diffusion problem


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= \alpha\nabla^2 u + f(\pmb{x}, t),\quad \pmb{x}\in\Omega, t\in (0,T],
        \\
        u(\pmb{x}, 0) & = I(\pmb{x}),\quad \pmb{x}\in\Omega,
        \\
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} &= 0,\quad\pmb{x}\in\partial\Omega,\ t\in (0,T]
        
        \thinspace .
        

Here, :math:`u(\pmb{x},t)` is the unknown function, :math:`\alpha` is a constant, and
:math:`f(\pmb{x},t)` and :math:`I(x)` are given functions. We have assigned the particular
boundary condition :eq:`fem:deq:diffu:bcN` to minimize
the details on handling boundary conditions in the finite element method.

Discretization in time by a Forward Euler scheme
------------------------------------------------

.. 2DO

.. N_s out: use N_t in time N in general space in all examples,

.. and change decay and vib to N_t


Time discretization  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can apply a finite difference method in time to :eq:`fem:deq:diffu:eq`.
First we need a mesh in time, here taken as uniform with
mesh points :math:`t_n = n\Delta t`, :math:`n=0,1,\ldots,N`.
A Forward Euler scheme consists of sampling :eq:`fem:deq:diffu:eq`
at :math:`t_n` and approximating the time derivative by a forward
difference :math:`[D_t^+ u]^n\approx
(u^{n+1}-u^n)/\Delta t`. This approximation turns :eq:`fem:deq:diffu:eq`
into a differential equation that is discrete in time, but still
continuous in space.
With a finite difference operator notation we can write the
time-discrete problem as


.. math::
        
        [D_t^+ u = \alpha\nabla^2 u + f(\pmb{x}, t)]^n,
        

for :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N-1`. Writing this equation out in detail and
isolating the unknown :math:`u^{n+1}` on the left-hand side, demonstrates that
the time-discrete problem is a recursive set of problems that are
continuous in space:


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:diffu:FE:eq:unp1
        
        u^{n+1} = u^n + \Delta t \left( \alpha\nabla^2 u^n + f(\pmb{x}, t_n)\right)
        
        \thinspace .
        

Given :math:`u^0=I`, we can use :eq:`fem:deq:diffu:FE:eq:unp1` to compute
:math:`u^1,u^2,\dots,u^N`.

For absolute clarity in the various stages of the discretizations, we
introduce :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}(\pmb{x},t)` as the exact solution of the space-and time-continuous
partial differential equation :eq:`fem:deq:diffu:eq` and
:math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}^n` as the time-discrete approximation that fulfills
:eq:`fem:deq:diffu:FE:eq:unp1`:


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial u_{\small\mbox{e}}}{\partial t} &= \alpha\nabla^2 u_{\small\mbox{e}} + f(\pmb{x}, t)
        ,\\
        u_{\small\mbox{e}}^{n+1} &= u_{\small\mbox{e}}^n + \Delta t \left( \alpha\nabla^2 u_{\small\mbox{e}}^n + f(\pmb{x}, t_n)\right)
        
        \thinspace .
        


Space discretization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now introduce a finite element approximation to :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}^n` and :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}^{n+1}`
in :eq:`fem:deq:diffu:FE:eq:uex:n`, where the coefficients depend on the
time level:


.. math::
        
        u_{\small\mbox{e}}^n &\approx u^n = \sum_{j=0}^{N_s} c_j^{n}{\varphi}_j(\pmb{x}),
        \\
        u_{\small\mbox{e}}^{n+1} &\approx u^{n+1} = \sum_{j=0}^{N_s} c_j^{n+1}{\varphi}_j(\pmb{x})
        
        \thinspace .
        

Note that we have introduced :math:`N_s` as the number of degrees of freedom
in the spatial (s) domain. The number of time points is denoted by :math:`N`.
Also note that we use :math:`u^n` as the numerical solution we want
to compute in a program, while :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}` and :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}^n` are used when
we occasionally
need to refer to the exact solution and the time-discrete solution,
respectively.

Variational forms  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A weighted residual method with weighting functions :math:`w_i` can
now be formulated. We insert :eq:`fem:deq:diffu:femapprox:n` and
:eq:`fem:deq:diffu:femapprox:np1` in
:eq:`fem:deq:diffu:FE:eq:uex:n` to obtain the residual


.. math::
         R = u^{n+1} - u^n - \Delta t \left( \alpha\nabla^2 u^n + f(\pmb{x}, t_n)\right)
        \thinspace .

The weighted residual principle,


.. math::
         \int_\Omega Rw_i{\, \mathrm{d}x} = 0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N_s,

results in


.. math::
        
        \int_\Omega
        \left\lbrack
        u^{n+1} - u^n - \Delta t \left( \alpha\nabla^2 u^n + f(\pmb{x}, t_n)\right)
        \right\rbrack w_i {\, \mathrm{d}x} =0,
        

for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_s`.

The Galerkin method corresponds to choosing :math:`w_i={\varphi}_i`.
Isolating the unknown :math:`u^{n+1}` on the left-hand side gives


.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega} u^{n+1}{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x} = \int_{\Omega}
        \left\lbrack u^n - \Delta t \left( \alpha\nabla^2 u^n + f(\pmb{x}, t_n)\right)
        \right\rbrack{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x}
        \thinspace .
        


As usual in spatial finite element problems involving second-order
derivatives, we apply integration by parts on the term :math:`\nabla^2 u^n{\varphi}_i`:


.. math::
         \int_{\Omega}\alpha\nabla^2 u^n{\varphi}_i dx =
        -\int_{\Omega}\alpha\nabla u^n\cdot\nabla{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x} +
        \int_{\partial\Omega}\alpha\frac{\partial u^n}{\partial n}{\varphi} dx
        \thinspace .
        

The last term vanishes because we have the Neumann condition
:math:`\partial u^n/\partial n=0` for all :math:`n`. Our discrete problem in
space and time then reads


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:diffu:FE:vf:u:np1
        
        \int_{\Omega} u^{n+1}{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        \int_{\Omega} u^n{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x} -
        \Delta t \int_{\Omega}\alpha\nabla u^n\cdot\nabla{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x} +
        \Delta t\int_{\Omega}f^n{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x}
        \thinspace .
        
        

This is the variational formulation of our recursive set of spatial
problems.

In a program it is only necessary to store :math:`u^{n+1}` and :math:`u^n` at the
same time. We therefore drop the :math:`n` index in programs and work with
two functions: ``u`` for :math:`u^{n+1}`, the new unknown, and ``u_1`` for
:math:`u^n`, the solution at the previous time level. This is also
convenient in the mathematics to maximize the correspondence with the
code. From now on :math:`u_1` means the discrete unknown at the previous
time level, :math:`u^{n}`, and :math:`u` represents the
discrete unknown at the new time level, :math:`u^{n+1}`.


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:diffu:FE:vf:u
        
        \int_{\Omega} u{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        \int_{\Omega} u_1{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x} -
        \Delta t \int_{\Omega}\alpha\nabla u_1\cdot\nabla{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x} +
        \Delta t\int_{\Omega}f^n{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x}
        \thinspace .
        
        

This variational form can alternatively be expressed by the inner
product notation:


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:diffu:FE:vf:u:short
        
        (u, {\varphi}_i) = (u_1,{\varphi}_i) -
        \Delta t (\alpha\nabla u_1,\nabla{\varphi}_i) +
        (f^n,{\varphi}_i)
        \thinspace .
        
        


Linear systems  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To derive the equations for the new coefficients, we insert


.. math::
         u = \sum_{j=0}^{N_s}c_j{\varphi}_j(\pmb{x}),\quad
        u_1 = \sum_{j=0}^{N_s} c_{1,j}{\varphi}(\pmb{x})

in :eq:`fem:deq:diffu:FE:vf:u` or :eq:`fem:deq:diffu:FE:vf:u:short`,
and order the terms as matrix-vector products:


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^{N_s} ({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j) c_j =
        \sum_{j=0}^{N_s} ({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j) c_{1,j}
        -\Delta t\alpha \sum_{j=0}^{N_s} (\nabla{\varphi}_i,\nabla{\varphi}_j) c_{1,j}
        + (f^n,{\varphi}_i),\quad i=0,\ldots,N_s
        \thinspace .
        

This is a linear system :math:`\sum_j A_{i,j} = b_i` with


.. math::
         A_{i,j} = ({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j)
        

and


.. math::
         b_i = \sum_{j=0}^{N_s} ({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j) c_{1,j}
        -\Delta t\alpha \sum_{j=0}^{N_s} (\nabla{\varphi}_i,\nabla{\varphi}_j) c_{1,j}
        + (f^n,{\varphi}_i)\thinspace . 


It is instructive and convenient for implementations to write the linear
system on the form


.. math::
        
        Mc = Mc_1 - \alpha\Delta t Kc_1 + f,
        

where


.. math::
        
        f &= ((f(\pmb{x},t_n),{\varphi}_i), \ldots, (f(\pmb{x},t_n),{\varphi}_{N_s})),\\
        c &=(c_0,\ldots,c_{N_s}),\\
        c_1 &= (c_{1,j},\ldots,c_{1,N_s}),
        

and :math:`M` and :math:`K` are matrices,


.. index:: mass matrix

.. index:: stiffness matrix



.. math::
         M_{i,j} = ({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j),\quad
        K_{i,j} =(\nabla{\varphi}_i,\nabla{\varphi}_j)
        \thinspace .

We realize that :math:`M` is the matrix arising from a term with the
zero-th derivative of :math:`u`, and called the mass matrix, while :math:`K` is
the matrix arising from a Laplace term :math:`\nabla^2 u`. The :math:`K` matrix
is often known as the *stiffness matrix*. (The terms mass and stiffness
stem from the early days of finite elements when applications to
vibrating structures dominated. The mass matrix arises from the
mass times acceleration term in Newton's second law, while the stiffness
matrix arises from the elastic forces in that law. The mass and stiffness
matrix appearing in a diffusion have slightly different mathematical
formulas.)

*Remark.* The mathematical symbol :math:`f` has two meanings, either the
function :math:`f(\pmb{x},t)` in the PDE or the :math:`f` vector in the linear system
to be solved at each time level. The symbol :math:`u` also has different
meanings, basically the unknown in the PDE or the finite element
function representing the unknown at a time level. The actual
meaning should be evident from the context.


Computational algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We observe that :math:`M` and :math:`K` can be precomputed so that we can avoid
assembly of the matrix system at every time level. Instead, some
matrix-vector multiplications will produce the linear system to be solved.
The computational algorithm has the following steps:

1. Compute :math:`M` and :math:`K`.

2. Initialize :math:`u^0` by

  1. interpolation: :math:`c_{1,j} = I(\pmb{x}_j)`, where :math:`\pmb{x}_j` is node number :math:`j`, or

  2. projection: solve
     :math:`\sum_j M_{i,j}c_{1,j} = (I,{\varphi}_i)`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_s`.


3. For :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N`:

  1. compute :math:`b = Mc_1 - \alpha\Delta t Kc_1 + f`

  2. solve :math:`Mc = b`

  3. set :math:`c_1 = c`


Comparison with the finite difference method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can compute the :math:`M` and :math:`K` matrices using P1 elements.
From the section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:comp:global` or
:ref:`fem:deq:1D:comp:elmwise` we have that the :math:`K` matrix is the same as we get
from the finite difference method: :math:`h[D_xD_x u]^n_i`, while
from the section :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fd:feproj` we know that :math:`M` can be
interpreted as the finite difference approximation:
:math:`[u - \frac{1}{6}h^2D_xD_x u]^n_i`. The equation system :math:`Mc=b` in
the algorithm is therefore equivalent to the finite difference scheme


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:diffu:FE:fdinterp
        
        [D_t^+(u - \frac{1}{6}h^2D_xD_x u) = \alpha D_xD_x u + f]^n_i
        
        \thinspace .
        


Lumping the mass matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By applying Trapezoidal integration or summing the rows in :math:`M` and placing
the sum on the main diagonal, one can turn :math:`M` into a diagonal
matrix with :math:`(h/2,h,\ldots,h,h/2)` on the diagonal. Then there are
no needs to solve a linear system at each time level, and the finite
element scheme becomes identical to a standard finite difference method


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:diffu:FE:fdinterp:lumped
        
        [D_t^+ u = \alpha D_xD_x u + f]^n_i
        
        \thinspace .
        


Discretization in time by a Backward Euler scheme
-------------------------------------------------

Time discretization  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Backward Euler scheme in time applied to our diffusion problem
can be expressed as follows using the finite difference operator notation:


.. math::
        
        [D_t^- u = \alpha\nabla^2 u + f(\pmb{x}, t)]^n
        \thinspace .
        

Written out, and collecting the unknown :math:`u^n` on the left-hand side,
the time-discrete differential equation becomes


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:diffu:BE:eq:un
        
        u^{n} - \Delta t \left( \alpha\nabla^2 u^n + f(\pmb{x}, t_{n})\right) = u^{n-1}
        
        \thinspace .
        

Equation :eq:`fem:deq:diffu:BE:eq:un` can compute
:math:`u^1,u^2,\dots,u^N`, if we have a start :math:`u^0=I` from the initial condition.

Variational forms  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Galerkin method applied to :eq:`fem:deq:diffu:BE:eq:un` and
integrating by parts, as in the Forward Euler case, results
in the variational form


.. math::

        \int_{\Omega} \left( u^{n}{\varphi}_i
        + \Delta t \alpha\nabla u^n\cdot\nabla{\varphi}_i\right){\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \int_{\Omega} u^{n-1}{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x} -
        \Delta t\int_{\Omega}f^n{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x}
        
        \thinspace .
        

Expressed with :math:`u` as :math:`u^n` and :math:`u_1` as :math:`u^{n-1}`, this becomes


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:diffu:BE:vf:u
        
        \int_{\Omega} \left( u{\varphi}_i
        + \Delta t \alpha\nabla u\cdot\nabla{\varphi}_i\right){\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \int_{\Omega} u_1{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x} +
        \Delta t\int_{\Omega}f^n{\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x},
        
        

or


.. math::

        (u,{\varphi}_i)
        + \Delta t \alpha(\nabla u,\nabla{\varphi}_i)
        = (u_1{\varphi}_i) +
        \Delta t (f^n,{\varphi}_i)
        
        \thinspace .
        


Linear systems  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inserting :math:`u=\sum_j c_j{\varphi}_i` and :math:`u_1=\sum_j c_{1,j}{\varphi}_i`,
we arrive after some algebra at the following linear system to be
solved at each time level:


.. math::
        
        (M + \Delta t \alpha K)c = Mc_1 + f,
        

where :math:`M`, :math:`K`, and :math:`f` are as in the Forward Euler case.
This time we really have to solve a linear system at each time level.
The system corresponds to solving the finite difference problem


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:diffu:BE:fdinterp
        
        [D_t^-(u - \frac{1}{6}h^2D_xD_x u) = \alpha D_xD_x u + f]^n_i
        
        \thinspace .
        


The mass matrix :math:`M` can be lumped, and then the linear system corresponds
to a plain Backward Euler finite difference method for the diffusion equation:


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:diffu:BE:fdinterp:lumped
        
        [D_t^- u = \alpha D_xD_x u + f]^n_i
        
        \thinspace .
        


Analysis of the discrete equations
----------------------------------

Let us see how a typical numerical wave component


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:diffu:analysis:uni
        
        u^n_q = A^n e^{ikq\Delta x} = A^ne^{ikx},
        
        

is treated by the schemes. With the results


.. math::
        
        [D_t^+ A^n e^{ikq\Delta x}]^n &= A^n e^{ikq\Delta x}\frac{A-1}{\Delta t},\\
        [D_t^- A^n e^{ikq\Delta x}]^n &= A^n e^{ikq\Delta x}\frac{1-A^{-1}}{\Delta t},\\
        [D_t A^n e^{ikq\Delta x}]^{n+\frac{1}{2}} &= A^{n+\frac{1}{2}} e^{ikq\Delta x}\frac{A^{\frac{1}{2}}-A^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Delta t} = A^ne^{ikq\Delta x}\frac{A-1}{\Delta t},\\
        [D_xD_x A^ne^{ikq\Delta x}]_q &= -A^n \frac{4}{\Delta x^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{k\Delta x}{2}\right),
        

we can start inserting :eq:`fem:deq:diffu:analysis:uni` in the
Forward Euler scheme with P1 elements in space and :math:`f=0`,


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:diffu:FE:fdinterp2
        
        [D_t^+(u - \frac{1}{6}h^2D_xD_x u) = \alpha D_xD_x u]^n_q
        
        \thinspace .
        

We have


.. math::
         [D_t^+D_xD_x Ae^{ikx}]^n_q = [D_t^+A]^n [D_xD_x e^{ikx}]_q
        = -A^ne^{ikp\Delta x}
        \frac{A-1}{\Delta t}\frac{4}{\Delta x^2}\sin^2 (\frac{k\Delta x}{2})
        \thinspace . 

The term :math:`[D_t^+A^ne^{ikx} - \frac{1}{6}\Delta x^2 D_t^+D_xD_x Ae^{ikx}]^n_q`
then reduces to


.. math::
         \frac{A-1}{\Delta t} + \frac{1}{6}\Delta x^2 \frac{A-1}{\Delta t}
        \frac{4}{\Delta x^2}\sin^2 (\frac{k\Delta x}{2}), 

or

.. math::
         \frac{A-1}{\Delta t} \left(1 + \frac{2}{3}\sin^2 (k\Delta x/2)\right)
        \thinspace . 

The complete scheme becomes


.. math::
        
        (A-1) \left(1 + \frac{2}{3}\sin^2 (k\Delta x/2)\right)
        = -4C\sin^2 (k\Delta x/2),

which we then solve for :math:`A`,


.. math::
         A = 1 - 4C\frac{\sin^2 (k\Delta x/2)}{1 + \frac{2}{3}\sin^2 (k\Delta x/2)}
        \thinspace .


How does this :math:`A` change the stability criterion compared to the
Forward Euler finite difference scheme and centered differences in
space? The stability criterion is :math:`-1<A`, meaning


.. math::
        
        4C\frac{\sin^2 (p/2}{1 + \frac{2}{3}\sin^2 (p/2)} \leq 2,
        

with :math:`p=k\Delta x`. The factor :math:`{\sin^2 (p/2}/(1 + \frac{2}{3}\sin^2 (p/2))`
can be plotted for :math:`p\in [0,\pi ]`, and the maximum value goes to 3/5
as :math:`p\rightarrow \pi`. The worst case for stability therefore occurs for
the shortest waves, and the stability criterion becomes


.. math::
        
        C\leq \frac{5}{6}\quad\Rightarrow\quad \Delta t\leq \frac{5\Delta x^2}{6\alpha},
        

which is a factor 5/3 better than for the standard Forward Euler
finite difference method for the diffusion equation.
Lumping the mass matrix will, however, recover the finite difference
method and imply :math:`C\leq 1/2` for stability.

.. plot and compare A_FE_FEM vs A_FE_FDM and exact


For the Backward Euler scheme


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:diffu:BE:fdinterp2
        
        [D_t^-(u - \frac{1}{6}h^2D_xD_x u) = \alpha D_xD_x u]^n_i
        
        \thinspace .
        


we get


.. math::
        
        (1-A^{-1}) \left(1 + \frac{2}{3}\sin^2 (k\Delta x/2)\right)
        = -4C\sin^2 (k\Delta x/2),

and hence


.. math::
        
        A = \left( 1 + 4C\frac{\sin^2 (k\Delta x/2)}{(1 + \frac{2}{3}\sin^2 (k\Delta x/2))}\right)^{-1}
        \thinspace .
        


**Remaining tasks**:

 * Plot :math:`A` vs :math:`A_{\small\mbox{e}}` for finite elements and finite differences
   for each of the time schemes.

.. _fem:sys:

Systems of differential equations
=================================


Many mathematical models involve :math:`m+1` unknown functions
governed by a system of :math:`m+1` differential equations. In abstract form
we may denote the unknowns by :math:`u^{(0)},\ldots,
u^{(m)}` and write the governing equations as


.. math::
        
        {\cal L}_0(u^{(0)},\ldots,u^{(m)}) &= 0,\\
        &\vdots\\
        {\cal L}_{m}(u^{(0)},\ldots,u^{(m)}) &= 0,
        

where :math:`{\cal L}_i` is some differential operator defining differential
equation number :math:`i`.

.. _fem:sys:vform:

Variational forms  (3)
----------------------

There are basically two ways of formulating a variational form
for a system of differential equations. The first method treats
each equation independently as a scalar equation, while the other
method views the total system as a vector equation with a vector function
as unknown.

Let us start with the one equation at a time approach.
We multiply equation number :math:`i` by
some test function :math:`v^{(i)}\in V^{(i)}` and integrate over the domain:


.. math::
        
        \int_\Omega {\cal L}^{(0)}(u^{(0)},\ldots,u^{(m)}) v^{(0)}{\, \mathrm{d}x} &= 0,
        \\
        &\vdots\\
        \int_\Omega {\cal L}^{(m)}(u^{(0)},\ldots,u^{(m)}) v^{(m)}{\, \mathrm{d}x} &= 0
        
        \thinspace .
        

Terms with second-order derivatives may be integrated by parts, with
Neumann conditions inserted in boundary integrals.
Let


.. math::
         V^{(i)} = \hbox{span}\{{\varphi}_0^{(i)},\ldots,{\varphi}_{N_i}^{(i)}\},

such that


.. math::
         u^{(i)} = B^{(i)}(\pmb{x}) + \sum_{j=0}^{N_i} c_j^{(i)} {\varphi}_j^{(i)}(\pmb{x}),
        

where :math:`B^{(i)}` is a boundary function to handle nonzero Dirichlet conditions.
Observe that different unknowns live in different spaces with different
basis functions and numbers of degrees of freedom.

From the :math:`m` equations in the variational forms we can derive
:math:`m` coupled systems of algebraic equations for the
:math:`\Pi_{i=0}^{m} N_i` unknown coefficients :math:`c_j^{(i)}`, :math:`j=0,\ldots,N_i`,
:math:`i=0,\ldots,m`.


The alternative method for deriving a variational form for a system of
differential equations introduces a vector of unknown functions


.. math::
         \pmb{u} = (u^{(0)},\ldots,u^{(m)}),

a vector of test functions


.. math::
         \pmb{v} = (u^{(0)},\ldots,u^{(m)}),

with


.. math::
         \pmb{u}, \pmb{v} \in  \pmb{V} = V^{(0)}\times \cdots \times V^{(m)}
        \thinspace .

With nonzero Dirichlet conditions, we have a vector
:math:`\pmb{B} = (B^{(0)},\ldots,B^{(m)})` with boundary functions and then
it is :math:`\pmb{u} - \pmb{B}` that lies in :math:`\pmb{V}`, not :math:`\pmb{u}` itself.

The governing system of differential equations is written


.. math::
         \pmb{\cal L}(\pmb{u} ) = 0,

where


.. math::
         \pmb{\cal L}(\pmb{u} ) = ({\cal L}^{(0)}(\pmb{u}),\ldots, {\cal L}^{(m)}(\pmb{u}))
        \thinspace .

The variational form is derived by taking the inner product of
the vector of equations and the test function vector:


.. math::
   :label: fem:sys:vform:inner
        
        \int_\Omega \pmb{\cal L}(\pmb{u} )\cdot\pmb{v} = 0\quad\forall\pmb{v}\in\pmb{V}\thinspace .
        
        


Observe that :eq:`fem:sys:vform:inner` is one scalar equation. To derive
systems of algebraic equations for the unknown coefficients in the
expansions of the unknown functions, one chooses :math:`m` linearly
independent :math:`\pmb{v}` vectors to generate :math:`m` independent variational forms
from :eq:`fem:sys:vform:inner`.  The particular choice :math:`\pmb{v} =
(v^{(0)},0,\ldots,0)` recovers :eq:`fem:sys:vform:1by1a`, :math:`\pmb{v} =
(0,\ldots,0,v^{(m)}` recovers :eq:`fem:sys:vform:1by1b`, and :math:`\pmb{v} =
(0,\ldots,0,v^{(i)},0,\ldots,0)` recovers the variational form number
:math:`i`, :math:`\int_\Omega {\cal L}^{(i)} v^{(i)}{\, \mathrm{d}x} =0`, in
:eq:`fem:sys:vform:1by1a`-:eq:`fem:sys:vform:1by1b`.

.. _fem:sys:uT:ex:

A worked example
----------------

We now consider a specific system of two partial differential equations
in two space dimensions:


.. math::
        
        \mu \nabla^2 w &= -\beta,
        \\
        \kappa\nabla^2 T &= - \mu ||\nabla w||^2
        \thinspace .
        
        

The unknown functions :math:`w(x,y)` and :math:`T(x,y)` are defined in a domain :math:`\Omega`,
while :math:`\mu`, :math:`\beta`,
and :math:`\kappa` are given constants. The norm in
:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:Teq` is the standard Eucledian norm:


.. math::
         ||\nabla w||^2 = \nabla w\cdot\nabla w = w_x^2 + w_y^2
        \thinspace .


The boundary conditions associated with
:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:weq`-:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:Teq` are :math:`w=0` on
:math:`\partial\Omega` and :math:`T=T_0` on :math:`\partial\Omega`.
Each of the equations :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:weq` and :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:Teq`
need one condition at each point on the boundary.

The system :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:weq`-:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:Teq` arises
from fluid flow in a straight pipe, with the :math:`z` axis in the direction
of the pipe. The domain :math:`\Omega` is a cross section of the pipe, :math:`w`
is the velocity in the :math:`z` direction, :math:`\mu`
is the viscosity of the fluid, :math:`\beta` is the pressure gradient along
the pipe, :math:`T` is the temperature,
and :math:`\kappa` is the heat conduction coefficient of the
fluid. The equation :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:weq` comes from the Navier-Stokes
equations, and :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:Teq` follows from the energy equation.
The term :math:`- \mu ||\nabla w||^2` models heating of the fluid
due to internal friction.

Observe that the system :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:weq`-:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:Teq` has
only a one-way coupling: :math:`T` depends on :math:`w`, but :math:`w` does not depend on
:math:`T`, because we can solve :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:weq` with respect
to :math:`w` and then :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:Teq` with respect to :math:`T`.
Some may argue that this is not a real system of PDEs, but just two scalar
PDEs. Nevertheless, the one-way coupling
is convenient when comparing different variational forms
and different implementations.

Identical function spaces for the unknowns
------------------------------------------

Let us first apply the same function space :math:`V` for :math:`w` and :math:`T`
(or more precisely, :math:`w\in V` and :math:`T-T_0 \in V`).
With


.. math::
         V = \hbox{span}\{{\varphi}_0(x,y),\ldots,{\varphi}_N(x,y)\}, 

we write


.. math::
   :label: fem:sys:wT:ex:sum
        
        w = \sum_{j=0}^N c^{(w)}_j {\varphi}_j,\quad T = T_0 + \sum_{j=0}^N c^{(T)}_j
        {\varphi}_j\thinspace .
        
        

Note that :math:`w` and :math:`T` in :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:weq`-:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:Teq`
denote the exact solution of the PDEs, while :math:`w` and :math:`T`
:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:sum` are the discrete functions that approximate
the exact solution. It should be clear from the context whether a
symbol means the exact or approximate solution, but when we need both
at the same time, we use a subscript e to denote the exact solution.

Variational form of each individual PDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inserting the expansions :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:sum`
in the governing PDEs, results in a residual in each equation,


.. math::
        
        R_w &= \mu \nabla^2 w + \beta,
        \\
        R_T &= \kappa\nabla^2 T + \mu ||\nabla w||^2
        \thinspace .
        
        

A Galerkin method demands :math:`R_w` and :math:`R_T` do be orthogonal to :math:`V`:


.. math::
        
        \int_\Omega R_w v {\, \mathrm{d}x} &=0\quad\forall v\in V,\\
        \int_\Omega R_T v {\, \mathrm{d}x} &=0\quad\forall v\in V
        \thinspace .
        

Because of the Dirichlet conditions, :math:`v=0` on :math:`\partial\Omega`.
We integrate the Laplace terms by parts and note that the boundary terms
vanish since :math:`v=0` on :math:`\partial\Omega`:


.. math::
        
        \int_\Omega \mu \nabla w\cdot\nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x} &= \int_\Omega \beta v{\, \mathrm{d}x}
        \quad\forall v\in V,
        \\
        \int_\Omega \kappa \nabla T\cdot\nabla v {\, \mathrm{d}x} &= \int_\Omega \mu
        \nabla w\cdot\nabla w\, v{\, \mathrm{d}x} \quad\forall v\in V
        
        \thinspace .
        


Compound scalar variational form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The alternative way of deriving the variational from is to
introduce a test vector function :math:`\pmb{v}\in\pmb{V} = V\times V` and take
the inner product of :math:`\pmb{v}` and the residuals, integrated over the domain:


.. math::
         \int_{\Omega} (R_w, R_T)\cdot\pmb{v} {\, \mathrm{d}x} = 0\quad\forall\pmb{v}\in\pmb{V}
        \thinspace .

With :math:`\pmb{v} = (v_0,v_1)` we get


.. math::
         \int_{\Omega} (R_w v_0 + R_T v_1) {\, \mathrm{d}x} = 0\quad\forall\pmb{v}\in\pmb{V}
        \thinspace .

Integrating the Laplace terms by parts results in


.. math::
   :label: fem:sys:wT:ex:wT:vf2
        
        \int_\Omega (\mu\nabla w\cdot\nabla v_0 + \kappa\nabla T\cdot\nabla v_1){\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \int_\Omega (\beta v_0 + \mu\nabla w\cdot\nabla w\, v_1){\, \mathrm{d}x},
        \quad\forall \pmb{v}\in\pmb{V}
        \thinspace .
        
        

Choosing :math:`v_0=v` and :math:`v_1=0` gives the variational form
:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:w:vf1`, while :math:`v_0=0` and :math:`v_1=v` gives
:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:T:vf1`.

With the inner product notation, :math:`(p,q) = \int_\Omega pq{\, \mathrm{d}x}`, we
can alternatively write :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:w:vf1` and
:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:T:vf1` as


.. math::
        
         (\mu\nabla w,\nabla v) &= (\beta, v)
        \quad\forall v\in V,\\
        (\kappa \nabla T,\nabla v) &= (\mu\nabla w\cdot\nabla w, v)\quad\forall v\in V,
        

or since :math:`\mu` and :math:`\kappa` are considered constant,


.. math::
        
        \mu (\nabla w,\nabla v) &= (\beta, v)
        \quad\forall v\in V,
        \\
        \kappa(\nabla T,\nabla v) &= \mu(\nabla w\cdot\nabla w, v)\quad\forall v\in V
        
        \thinspace .
        


Decoupled linear systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The linear systems governing the coefficients :math:`c_j^{(w)}` and
:math:`c_j^{(T)}`, :math:`j=0,\ldots,N`, are derived by inserting the
expansions :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:sum` in :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:w:vf1`
and :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:T:vf1`, and choosing :math:`v={\varphi}_i` for
:math:`i=0,\ldots,N`. The result becomes


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^N A^{(w)}_{i,j} c^{(w)}_j &= b_i^{(w)},\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        \\
        \sum_{j=0}^N A^{(T)}_{i,j} c^{(T)}_j &= b_i^{(T)},\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        \\
        A^{(w)}_{i,j} &= \mu(\nabla {\varphi}_j,\nabla {\varphi}_i),\\
        b_i^{(w)} &= (\beta, {\varphi}_i),\\
        A^{(T)}_{i,j} &= \kappa(\nabla {\varphi}_j,\nabla {\varphi}_i),\\
        b_i^{(T)} &= \mu((\sum_j c^{(w)}_j\nabla{\varphi}_j)\cdot (\sum_k
        c^{(w)}_k\nabla{\varphi}_k), {\varphi}_i)
        \thinspace .
        


It can also be instructive to write the linear systems using matrices
and vectors. Define :math:`K` as the matrix corresponding to the Laplace
operator :math:`\nabla^2`. That is, :math:`K_{i,j} = (\nabla {\varphi}_j,\nabla {\varphi}_i)`.
Let us introduce the vectors


.. math::
        
        b^{(w)} &= (b_0^{(w)},\ldots,b_{N}^{(w)}),
        b^{(T)} &= (b_0^{(T)},\ldots,b_{N}^{(T)}),
        c^{(w)} &= (c_0^{(w)},\ldots,c_{N}^{(w)}),
        c^{(T)} &= (c_0^{(T)},\ldots,c_{N}^{(T)})\thinspace .
        

The system :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:linsys:w1`-:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:linsys:T1`
can now be expressed in matrix-vector form as


.. math::
        
        \mu K c^{(w)} &= b^{(w)},\\
        \kappa K c^{(T)} &= b^{(T)}\thinspace .
        


We can solve the first system for :math:`c^{(w)}`, and then
the right-hand side :math:`b^{(T)}` is known such that we can
solve the second system for :math:`c^{(T)}`.


Coupled linear systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Despite the fact that :math:`w` can be computed first, without knowing :math:`T`,
we shall now pretend that :math:`w` and :math:`T` enter a two-way coupling such
that we need to derive the
algebraic equations as *one system* for all the unknowns
:math:`c_j^{(w)}` and :math:`c_j^{(T)}`, :math:`j=0,\ldots,N`. This system is
nonlinear in :math:`c_j^{(w)}` because of the :math:`\nabla w\cdot\nabla w` product.
To remove this nonlinearity, imagine that we introduce an iteration
method where we replace :math:`\nabla w\cdot\nabla w` by
:math:`\nabla w_{-}\cdot\nabla w`, :math:`w_{-}` being the :math:`w`
computed in the previous iteration. Then the term
:math:`\nabla w_{-}\cdot\nabla w` is linear in :math:`w` since :math:`w_{-}` is
known. The total linear system becomes


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^N A^{(w,w)}_{i,j} c^{(w)}_j + \sum_{j=0}^N A^{(w,T)}_{i,j} c^{(T)}_j
        &= b_i^{(w)},\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        \\
        \sum_{j=0}^N A^{(T,w)}_{i,j} c^{(w)}_j + \sum_{j=0}^N A^{(T,T)}_{i,j} c^{(T)}_j &= b_i^{(T)},\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        \\
        A^{(w,w)}_{i,j} &= \mu(\nabla {\varphi}_j,{\varphi}_i),\\
        A^{(w,T)}_{i,j} &= 0,\\
        b_i^{(w)} &= (\beta, {\varphi}_i),\\
        A^{(w,T)}_{i,j} &= \mu((\nabla{\varphi} w_{-})\cdot\nabla{\varphi}_j), {\varphi}_i),\\
        A^{(T,T)}_{i,j} &= \kappa(\nabla {\varphi}_j,{\varphi}_i),\\
        b_i^{(T)} &= 0
        \thinspace .
        

This system can alternatively be written in matrix-vector form as


.. math::
        
        \mu K c^{(w)} &= 0 b^{(w)},\\
        L c^{(w)} + \kappa K c^{(T)} & =0,
        

with :math:`L` as the matrix from the :math:`\nabla w_{-}\cdot\nabla` operator:
:math:`L_{i,j} = A^{(w,T)}_{i,j}`.

The matrix-vector equations are often conveniently written in block form:


.. math::
        
        \left(\begin{array}{cc}
        \mu K & 0\\
        L & \kappa K
        \end{array}\right)
        \left(\begin{array}{c}
        c^{(w)}\\
        c^{(T)}
        \end{array}\right) =
        \left(\begin{array}{c}
        b^{(w)}\\
        0
        \end{array}\right),
        


Note that in the general case where all unknowns enter all equations,
we have to solve the compound system
:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:linsys:w2`-:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:linsys:T2` since
then we cannot utilize the special property that
:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:linsys:w1` does not involve :math:`T` and can be solved
first.

When the viscosity depends on the temperature, the
:math:`\mu\nabla^2w` term must be replaced by :math:`\nabla\cdot (\mu(T)\nabla w)`,
and then :math:`T` enters the equation for :math:`w`. Now we have a two-way coupling
since both equations contain :math:`w` and :math:`T` and therefore
must be solved simultaneously
Th equation :math:`\nabla\cdot (\mu(T)\nabla w)=-\beta` is nonlinear,
and if some iteration procedure is invoked, where we use a previously
computed :math:`T_{-}` in the viscosity (:math:`\mu(T_{-})`), the coefficient is known,
and the equation involves only one unknown, :math:`w`. In that case we are
back to the one-way coupled set of PDEs.


We may also formulate our PDE system as a vector equation. To this end,
we introduce the vector of unknowns :math:`\pmb{u} = (u^{(0)},u^{(1)})`,
where :math:`u^{(0)}=w` and :math:`u^{(1)}=T`. We then have


.. math::
        
        \nabla^2 \pmb{u} = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
        -{\mu}^{-1}{\beta}\\
        -{\kappa}^{-1}\mu \nabla u^{(0)}\cdot\nabla u^{(0)}
        \end{array}\right)\thinspace .
        


Different function spaces for the unknowns
------------------------------------------


.. index:: mixed finite elements


It is easy to generalize the previous formulation to the case where
:math:`w\in V^{(w)}` and :math:`T\in V^{(T)}`, where :math:`V^{(w)}` and :math:`V^{(T)}`
can be different spaces with different numbers of degrees of freedom.
For example, we may use quadratic basis functions for :math:`w` and linear
for :math:`T`. Approximation of the unknowns by different finite element
spaces is known as *mixed finite element methods*.

We write


.. math::
        
        V^{(w)} &= \hbox{span}\{{\varphi}_0^{(w)},\ldots,{\varphi}_{N_w}^{(w)}\},\\
        V^{(T)} &= \hbox{span}\{{\varphi}_0^{(T)},\ldots,{\varphi}_{N_T}^{(T)}\}
        \thinspace .
        

The next step is to
multiply :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:weq` by a test function :math:`v^{(w)}\in V^{(w)}`
and :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:Teq` by a :math:`v^{(T)}\in V^{(T)}`, integrate by
parts and arrive at


.. math::
        
        \int_\Omega \mu \nabla w\cdot\nabla v^{(w)} {\, \mathrm{d}x} &= \int_\Omega \beta v^{(w)}{\, \mathrm{d}x}
        \quad\forall v^{(w)}\in V^{(w)},
        \\
        \int_\Omega \kappa \nabla T\cdot\nabla v^{(T)} {\, \mathrm{d}x} &= \int_\Omega \mu
        \nabla w\cdot\nabla w\, v^{(T)}{\, \mathrm{d}x} \quad\forall v^{(T)}\in V^{(T)}
        
        \thinspace .
        


The compound scalar variational formulation applies a test vector function
:math:`\pmb{v} = (v^{(w)}, v^{(T)})` and reads


.. math::
   :label: fem:sys:wT:ex:wT:vf3
        
        \int_\Omega (\mu\nabla w\cdot\nabla v^{(w)} +
        \kappa\nabla T\cdot\nabla v^{(T)}){\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \int_\Omega (\beta v^{(w)} + \mu\nabla w\cdot\nabla w\, v^{(T)}){\, \mathrm{d}x},
        
        

valid :math:`\forall \pmb{v}\in\pmb{V} = V^{(w)}\times V^{(T)}`.

The associated linear system is similar to
:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:linsys:w1`-:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:linsys:T1`
or
:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:linsys:w2`-:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:linsys:T2`,
except that we need to distinguish between :math:`{\varphi}_i^{(w)}`
and :math:`{\varphi}_i^{(T)}`, and the range in the sums over :math:`j`
must match the number of degrees of freedom in the spaces :math:`V^{(w)}`
and :math:`V^{(T)}`. The formulas become


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^{N_w} A^{(w)}_{i,j} c^{(w)}_j &= b_i^{(w)},\quad i=0,\ldots,N_w,
        \\
        \sum_{j=0}^{N_T} A^{(T)}_{i,j} c^{(T)}_j &= b_i^{(T)},\quad i=0,\ldots,N_T,
        \\
        A^{(w)}_{i,j} &= \mu(\nabla {\varphi}_j^{(w)},{\varphi}_i^{(w)}),\\
        b_i^{(w)} &= (\beta, {\varphi}_i^{(w)}),\\
        A^{(T)}_{i,j} &= \kappa(\nabla {\varphi}_j^{(T)},{\varphi}_i^{(T)}),\\
        b_i^{(T)} &= \mu(\nabla w_{-}, {\varphi}_i^{(T)})
        \thinspace .
        


In the case we formulate one compound linear system involving
both :math:`c^{(w)}_j`, :math:`j=0,\ldots,N_w`, and :math:`c^{(T)}_j`, :math:`j=0,\ldots,N_T`,
:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:linsys:w2`-:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:linsys:T2`
becomes


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^{N_w} A^{(w,w)}_{i,j} c^{(w)}_j + \sum_{j=0}^{N_T} A^{(w,T)}_{i,j} c^{(T)}_j
        &= b_i^{(w)},\quad i=0,\ldots,N_w,
        \\
        \sum_{j=0}^{N_w} A^{(T,w)}_{i,j} c^{(w)}_j + \sum_{j=0}^{N_T} A^{(T,T)}_{i,j} c^{(T)}_j &= b_i^{(T)},\quad i=0,\ldots,N_T,
        \\
        A^{(w,w)}_{i,j} &= \mu(\nabla {\varphi}_j^{(w)},{\varphi}_i^{(w)}),\\
        A^{(w,T)}_{i,j} &= 0,\\
        b_i^{(w)} &= (\beta, {\varphi}_i^{(w)}),\\
        A^{(w,T)}_{i,j} &= \mu (\nabla w_{-}\cdot\nabla{\varphi}_j^{(w)}), {\varphi}_i^{(T)}),\\
        A^{(T,T)}_{i,j} &= \kappa(\nabla {\varphi}_j^{(T)},{\varphi}_i^{(T)}),\\
        b_i^{(T)} &= 0
        \thinspace .
        

The corresponding block form


.. math::
        
        \left(\begin{array}{cc}
        \mu K^{(w)} & 0\\
        L & \kappa K^{(T)}
        \end{array}\right)
        \left(\begin{array}{c}
        c^{(w)}\\
        c^{(T)}
        \end{array}\right) =
        \left(\begin{array}{c}
        b^{(w)}\\
        0
        \end{array}\right),
        

has square and rectangular block matrices: :math:`K^{(w)}` is :math:`N_w\times N_w`,
:math:`K^{(T)}` is :math:`N_T\times N_T`, while :math:`L` is :math:`N_T\times N_w`,

We can reduce the system :eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:weq`-:eq:`fem:sys:wT:ex:Teq`

two flat plates. Alternatively, one may consider flow in a circular
pipe, introduce cylindrical coordinates, and utilize the radial symmetry
to reduce the equations to a one-dimensional problem in the radial
coordinate. The former model becomes

        \kappa T_{xx} &= - \mu w_x^2,

Exercise 17: Compute the deflection of a cable with sine functions
------------------------------------------------------------------

A hanging cable of length :math:`L`
with significant tension has a downward deflection :math:`w(x)`
governed by

Solve

.. math::
        
        T w''(x) = \ell(x),
        

where :math:`T` is the tension in the cable
and :math:`\ell(x)` the load per unit length.
The cable is fixed at :math:`x=0` and :math:`x=L` so the boundary conditions become
:math:`T(0)=T(L)=0`. We assume a constant load :math:`\ell(x)=\hbox{const}`.

The solution is expected to be symmetric around :math:`x=L/2`. Formulating
the problem for :math:`x\in [0,L/2]` and then scaling it, results in
the scaled problem for the dimensionless vertical deflection :math:`u`:

We consider the deflection of a tension cable as described in

This load is not symmetric

Incorporation of Dirichlet conditions can either be done by

Exercise 25: Compare finite elements and differences for a radially symmetric Poisson equation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We consider the Poisson problem in a disk with radius :math:`R` with
Dirichlet conditions at the boundary.
Given that the solution is radially symmetric and hence dependent only on
the radial coordinate (:math:`r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}`), we can reduce the problem
to a 1D Poisson equation


.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:exer:1D:Poisson:polar:eq
        
        -\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\left( r\frac{du}{dr}\right) = f(r),\quad r\in (0,R),\
        u'(0)=0,\ u(R)=U_R
        \thinspace .
        
        



*a)* Derive a variational form of :eq:`fem:deq:exer:1D:Poisson:polar:eq`
by integrating over the whole disk, or posed equivalently: use
a weighting function :math:`2\pi r v(r)` and integrate :math:`r` from :math:`0` to :math:`R`.

*b)* Use a uniform mesh partition with P1 elements and show what the
resulting set of equations becomes. Integrate the matrix entries
exact by hand, but use a Trapezoidal rule to integrate the :math:`f` term.

*c)* Explain that a natural
finite difference method applied to :eq:`fem:deq:exer:1D:Poisson:polar:eq`
gives


.. math::
        
        \frac{1}{r_i}\frac{1}{h^2}\left( r_{i+\frac{1}{2}}(u_{i+1}-u_i) -
        r_{i-\frac{1}{2}}(u_{i}-u_{i-1})\right) = f_i,\quad i=rh
        \thinspace .
        


For :math:`i=0` the factor :math:`1/r_i` seemingly becomes problematic. One must always
have :math:`u'(0)=0`, because of the radial symmetry, which implies
:math:`u_{-1}=u_1`, if we allow introduction of a fictitious value :math:`u_{-1}`.
Using this :math:`u_{-1}` in the difference equation for :math:`i=0` gives


.. math::
        
        \frac{1}{r_0}\frac{1}{h^2}\left( r_{\frac{1}{2}}(u_{1}-u_0) -
        r_{-\frac{1}{2}}(u_{0}-u_{1})\right) =
        \frac{1}{r_0}\frac{1}{2h^2}\left( (r_0 + r_1)(u_{1}-u_0) -
        (r_{-1} + r_0)(u_{0}-u_{1})\right) \approx
        2(u_1-u_0),
        

if we use :math:`r_{-1}+r_1\approx 2r_0`.

Set up the complete set of equations for the finite difference method
and compare to the finite element method in case a Trapezoidal rule

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The classical problem of applying a torque to the ends of a rod
can be modeled by a Poisson equation defined in the cross section :math:`\Omega`:


.. math::
         -\nabla^2 u = 2,\quad (x,y)\in\Omega,

with :math:`u=0` on :math:`\partial\Omega`. Exactly the same problem arises for
the deflection of a membrane with shape :math:`\Omega` under a constant load.

For a circular cross section one can readily
find an analytical solution. For a rectangular cross section the analytical
approach ends up with a sine series. The idea in this exercise is to
use a single basis function to obtain an approximate answer.

We assume for simplicity that the cross section is the unit square:
:math:`\Omega = [0,1]\times [0,1]`.


*a)* We consider the basis
:math:`{\varphi}_{p,q}(x,y) = \sin((p+1)\pi x)\sin (q\pi y)`, :math:`p,q=0,\ldots,n`.
These basis functions fulfill the Dirichlet condition.
Use a Galerkin method and :math:`n=0`.

*b)* The basis function involving sine functions are orthogonal.
Use this property in the Galerkin method
to derive the coefficients :math:`c_{p,q}` in a
formula :math:`u=\sum_p\sum_q c_{p,q}{\varphi}_{p,q}(x,y)`.

*c)* Another possible basis is
:math:`{\varphi}_i(x,y) = (x(1-x)y(1-y))^{i+1}`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`.
Use the Galerkin method to compute the solution for :math:`N=0`.
Which choice of a single basis function is best,
:math:`u\sim x(1-x)y(1-y)` or :math:`u\sim \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)`?
In order to answer the question,
it is necessary to search the web or the literature for an accurate
estimate of the maximum :math:`u` value at :math:`x=y=1/2`.
