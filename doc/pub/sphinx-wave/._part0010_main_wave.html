these components (i.e., the direction of the wave) is often

<p>A subsea earthquake leads to an immediate lift of the water surface, see
Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#wave-app-fig-1d-tsunami-flat"><em>Sketch of initial water surface due to a subsea earthquake</em></a>.  The lifted water surface
splits into two
tsunamis, one traveling to the right and one to the left, as depicted
in Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#wave-app-fig-1d-tsunami-2waves"><em>An initial surface elevation is split into two waves</em></a>.  Since tsunamis are
normally very long waves, compared to the depth, with a small
amplitude, compared to the wave length, the wave equation model
described in the section <a class="reference internal" href="._part0008_main_wave.html#wave-app-sw-2d"><em>The linear shallow water equations</em></a> is relevant:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\eta_{tt} = (gH(x)\eta_x)_x,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is the acceleration of gravity, and <span class="math">\(H(x)\)</span> is the still water depth.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>An initial surface elevation is split into two waves</em></p>
</div>
<p>To simulate the right-going tsunami, we can impose
a symmetry boundary at <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span>: <span class="math">\(\partial\eta\ \partial x =0\)</span>.
We then simulate the wave motion
in <span class="math">\([0,L]\)</span>. Unless the ocean ends at <span class="math">\(x=L\)</span>, the waves should travel
undisturbed through the boundary <span class="math">\(x=L\)</span>. A radiation condition
as explained in <a class="reference internal" href="#wave-app-exer-radiationbc"><em>Problem 20: Implement open boundary conditions</em></a> can be
used for this purpose. Alternatively, one can just stop the simulations
before the wave hits the boundary at <span class="math">\(x=L\)</span>. In that case it does not
matter what kind of boundary condition we use
at <span class="math">\(x=L\)</span>. Imposing <span class="math">\(\eta =0\)</span> and stopping the simulations when
<span class="math">\(|\eta_i^n| &gt; \epsilon\)</span>, <span class="math">\(i=N_x-1\)</span>, is a possibility (<span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> is a
small parameter).</p>
<p>The shape of the initial surface can be taken as a
Gaussian function,</p>
<div class="math">
\[I(x;I_0,I_a,I_m,I_s) =
I_0 + I_a\exp{\left(-\left(\frac{x-I_m}{I_s}\right)^2\right)},\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math">\(I_m=0\)</span> reflecting the location of the peak of <span class="math">\(I(x)\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(I_s\)</span> being a measure of the width of the function <span class="math">\(I(x)\)</span>
(<span class="math">\(I_s\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> times the standard deviation of the familiar
normal distribution curve).</p>
<p>Now we extend the problem with a hill at the sea
bottom, see Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#wave-app-fig-1d-tsunami-hill"><em>Sketch of an earthquake-generated tsunami passing over a subsea hill</em></a>. The wave speed
<span class="math">\(c=\sqrt{gH(x)} = \sqrt{g(H_0-B(x))}\)</span> will then be reduced in the
shallow water above the hill.</p>

Visualize both the bottom topography and the

<a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill:box">(7)</a>, or <span class="math">\(B(x)=B_0\)</span> (flat).</p>
<p>The purpose of this problem is to explore the quality of the numerical
solution <span class="math">\(\eta^n_i\)</span> for different shapes of the bottom obstruction.
The &#8220;cosine hat&#8221; and the box-shaped hills have abrupt changes in the
derivative of <span class="math">\(H(x)\)</span> and are more likely to generate numerical noise
than the smooth Gaussian shape of the hill. Investigate if this is true.

<p>Note that the initial condition and the listed bottom shapes are
symmetric around the line <span class="math">\(y=B_{my}\)</span>. We therefore expect the surface
elevation also to be symmetric with respect to this line.  This means
that we can halve the computational domain by working with
<span class="math">\([0,L_x]\times [0, B_{my}]\)</span>. Along the upper boundary, <span class="math">\(y=B_{my}\)</span>, we
must impose the symmetry condition <span class="math">\(\partial \eta/\partial n=0\)</span>.  Such
a symmetry condition (<span class="math">\(-\eta_x=0\)</span>) is also needed at the <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span>
boundary because the initial condition has a symmetry here. At the
lower boundary <span class="math">\(y=0\)</span> we also set a Neumann condition (which becomes
<span class="math">\(-\eta_y=0\)</span>).  The wave motion is to be simulated until the wave hits
the reflecting boundaries where <span class="math">\(\partial\eta/\partial n =\eta_x =0\)</span>
(one can also set <span class="math">\(\eta =0\)</span> - the particular condition does not matter

<p>The goal of this exercise is to simulate seismic waves using the
PDE model <a href="#equation-wave:app:acoustic:seismic:accoustic1a">(?)</a> in a
2D <span class="math">\(xz\)</span> domain with geological layers.
Introduce <span class="math">\(m\)</span> horizontal layers of thickness <span class="math">\(h_i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(i=0,\ldots,m-1\)</span>.
Inside layer number <span class="math">\(i\)</span> we have a vertical wave velocity <span class="math">\(c_{z,i}\)</span>
and a horizontal wave velocity <span class="math">\(c_{h,i}\)</span>. Make a program
for simulating such 2D waves. Test it on a case with 3 layers where</p>
<div class="math">

The source can be a localized Gaussian peak that oscillates in
time for some time interval.
Place the boundaries far enough from the expanding wave so that the

<p>The equation for sound waves in air is derived in the section <a class="reference internal" href="._part0007_main_wave.html#wave-app-sound"><em>Sound waves in liquids and gases</em></a>
and reads</p>
<div class="math">
\[p_{tt} = c^2\nabla^2 p,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(p(x,y,z,t)\)</span> is the pressure and <span class="math">\(c\)</span>
is the speed of sound, taken as 340 m/s.</p>
<p>However, sound is absorbed in the air due to relaxation of molecules
in the gas. A model for simple relaxation, valid for gases consisting
only of one type of molecules, is a term <span class="math">\(c^2\tau_s\nabla^2 p_t\)</span> in
the PDE, where <span class="math">\(\tau_s\)</span> is the relaxation time. If we generate sound
from, e.g., a loudspeaker in the room, this sound source must also
be added to the governing equation.</p>
<p>The PDE with the mentioned type of damping and source then becomes</p>
<div class="math">
\[p_tt = c^2\nabla^p + c^2\tau_s\nabla^2 p_t + f,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(f(x,y,z,t)\)</span> is the source term.</p>
<p>The walls can absorb some sound. A possible model is to have a &#8220;wall layer&#8221;
(thicker than the physical wall)
outside the room where <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is changed such that some of the wave energy
is reflected and some is absorbed in the wall. The absorption of
energy can be taken care of by adding a damping term <span class="math">\(bp_t\)</span> in
the equation:</p>
<div class="math">
\[p_tt + bp_t = c^2\nabla^p + c^2\tau_s\nabla^2 p_t + f{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Typically, <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span> in the room and <span class="math">\(b&gt;0\)</span> in the wall. A discontinuity in <span class="math">\(b\)</span>
or <span class="math">\(c\)</span> will give rise to reflections. It can be wise to use a constant
<span class="math">\(c\)</span> in the wall to control reflections because of the discontinuity between
<span class="math">\(c\)</span> in the air and in the wall, while <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is gradually increased
as we go into the wall to avoid reflections because of rapid changes in <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.
At the outer boundary of the wall the condition <span class="math">\(p=0\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\partial p/\partial n=0\)</span> can be imposed. The waves should anyway be approximately dampened
to <span class="math">\(p=0\)</span> this far out in the wall layer.</p>
<p>There are two strategies for discretizing the <span class="math">\(\nabla^2 p_t\)</span> term: using
a center difference between times <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> (if the equation is
sampled at level <span class="math">\(n\)</span>), or use a one-sided difference based on levels <span class="math">\(n\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span>. The latter has the advantage of not leading to any equation system,
while the former is second-order accurate as the scheme for the
simple wave equation <span class="math">\(p_tt = c^2\nabla^2 p\)</span>. To avoid an equation system,
go for the one-sided difference such that the overall scheme becomes
explicit and only of first order in time.</p>
<p>Develop a 3D solver for the specified PDE and introduce a wall layer.
Test the solver with the method of manufactured solutions. Make some
demonstrations where the wall reflects and absorbs the waves (reflection
because of discontinuity in <span class="math">\(b\)</span> and absorption because of growing <span class="math">\(b\)</span>).
Experiment with the impact of the <span class="math">\(\tau_s\)</span> parameter.

<p>and <em>one</em> periodic boundary condition</p>
<div class="math">

<p>This boundary condition means that what goes out of the domain at <span class="math">\(x=L\)</span>
comes in at <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span>. Roughly speaking,
we need only one boundary condition because of
the spatial derivative is of first order only.</p>
<p><em>Physical interpretation.</em> The parameter <span class="math">\(c\)</span> can be constant or variable, <span class="math">\(c=c(x)\)</span>. The
equation <a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:advec1D:ueq">(11)</a> arises in <em>transport</em>
problems where a quantity <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, which could be temperature or
concentration of some contaminant, is transported with the velocity
<span class="math">\(c\)</span> of a fluid. In addition to the transport imposed by &#8220;travelling with
the fluid&#8221;, <span class="math">\(u\)</span> may also be transported by diffusion (such as
heat conduction or Fickian diffusion), but we have in
the model <span class="math">\(u_t + cu_x\)</span> assumed that diffusion effects are negligible,
which they often are.</p>
<p>A widely used numerical scheme for <a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:advec1D:ueq">(11)</a>

<p>We shall hereafter assume that <span class="math">\(=c(x)&gt;0\)</span>.</p>
<p>To compute <a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:advec1D:u:avar:sol">(17)</a> we need to integrate
<span class="math">\(1/c\)</span> to obtain <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and then compute the inverse of <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>The inverse function computation can be easily done if we first think
discretely. Say we have some function <span class="math">\(y=g(x)\)</span> and seeks its inverse.
Plotting <span class="math">\((x_i,y_i)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(y_i=g(x_i)\)</span> for some mesh points <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span>,
displays <span class="math">\(g\)</span> as a function of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.
The inverse function is simply <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as a function of <span class="math">\(g\)</span>, i.e., the
curve with points <span class="math">\((y_i,x_i)\)</span>. We can therefore quickly compute points
at the curve of the inverse function. One way of extending these
points to a continuous function is to assume a linear variation
(known as linear interpolation)
between the points (which actually means to draw straight lines between
the points, exactly as done by a plotting program).</p>
<p>The function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wrap2callable</span></tt> in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">scitools.std</span></tt> can take a set of points
and return a continuous function that corresponds to linear

<p>fulfills the PDE as well as the initial and boundary condition
(provided <span class="math">\(I(0)=I(L)\)</span>).</p>
<p><em>b)</em> Set up a computational algorithm and implement it in a function.
Assume <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is constant and positive.</p>
<p><em>c)</em> Test implementation by using the remarkable property that
the numerical solution is exact at the mesh points if
<span class="math">\(\Delta t = c^{-1}\Delta x\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>d)</em> Make a movie comparing the numerical and exact solution for the

Analytically, we have that the <em>Fourier component</em></p>
<div class="math">
\[u(x,t) = e^{i(kx-\omega t)},\]</div>
<p>is a solution of the PDE if <span class="math">\(\omega = kc\)</span>. This is the <em>analytical

<p>Insert the discrete Fourier component in the numerical scheme and

the discrete dispersion relation. Show in particular that if
the <span class="math">\(\Delta t/(c\Delta x)=1\)</span>, the discrete solution coincides with the

Show that if the stability condition</p>
<div class="math">

<p>the discrete Fourier component cannot grow (i.e., <span class="math">\(\tilde\omega\)</span> is real).</p>
<p><em>f)</em> Write a test for your implementation where you try to use information

This can be used to derive an exact solution when <span class="math">\(a\)</span> varies

<p><em>i)</em> Use the initial condition to show that an exact solution is</p>

<p>with <span class="math">\(C^{-1}\)</span> being the inverse function of <span class="math">\(C = \int c^{1}dx\)</span>.
Since <span class="math">\(C(x)\)</span> is an integral <span class="math">\(\int_0^x (1/c)dx\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(C(x)\)</span> is monotonically increasing and there exists hence an
