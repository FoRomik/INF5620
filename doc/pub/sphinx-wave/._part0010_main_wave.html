<p>A subsea earthquake leads to an immediate lift of the surface, see
Figure <a class="reference internal" href="main_wave.html#wave-app-fig-1d-tsunami-flat"><em>Sketch of initial water surface due to a subsea earthquake</em></a>. The initial surface shape <span class="math">\(I(x)\)</span> is symmetric
around <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span> and will split into two tsunamis, one traveling to the right
and one to the left, as depicted in Figure <a class="reference internal" href="main_wave.html#wave-app-fig-1d-tsunami-2waves"><em>An initial surface elevation is split into two waves</em></a>.
Since the water surface will remain symmetric with respect to <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span>, given that
the outgoing wave to the left does not come back due to reflection,
we insert a boundary <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span> and impose a symmetry condition there: <span class="math">\(\partial\eta\
\partial x =0\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\eta(x,t)\)</span> is the elevation of the water surface.
We are not interested in what happens with the right-going wave after
it hits the right boundary, so whether we impose
<span class="math">\(\eta =0\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\partial\eta /\partial x=0\)</span> at that boundary is not of importance.</p>
<p>The shape of the initial surface can be taken as a
Gaussian function,</p>
<div class="math">
\[I(x;I_0,I_a,I_m,I_s) =
I_0 + I_a\exp{\left(-\left(\frac{x-I_m}{I_s}\right)^2\right)},\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math">\(I_m=0\)</span> reflecting the location of the peak of <span class="math">\(I(x)\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(I_s\)</span> being a measure of the width of the function <span class="math">\(I(x)\)</span>
(<span class="math">\(I_s\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> times the standard deviation of the familiar
normal distribution curve).</p>
<p>Set up the relevant one-dimensional, linear, wave equation for <span class="math">\(\eta\)</span>,
assuming long waves of small amplitude in comparison with the depth,
as described in the section <a class="reference internal" href="main_wave.html#wave-app-sw-2d"><em>The linear shallow water equations</em></a>. Import the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">viz</span></tt> method
from the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wave1D.py</span></tt> program and make a call to it to solve the
present tsunami problem.  The constant speed of the right-going wave is
<span class="math">\(c=\sqrt{gH}\)</span> and use this quantity to determine a suitable time <span class="math">\(T\)</span>
for when the wave hits the right boundary and the simulation is to be
stopped. An alternative is to check in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plot_u</span></tt> if <span class="math">\(u[-2]\)</span> is
significantly different from 0 and then return <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">True</span></tt> to stop
the simulation.</p>

<span class="target" id="index-0"></span><p id="index-1">To enable the right-going wave in <a class="reference internal" href="main_wave.html#wave-app-exer-tsunami1d"><em>Exercise 17: Earthquake-generated tsunami in a 1D model</em></a>
to leave the computational domain and travel undisturbed through
the boundary, one can in a one-dimensional problem impose the
following condition, called a <em>radiation condition</em> or
<em>open boundary condition</em>:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:radiation:eq">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[     \frac{\partial\eta}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial\eta}{\partial x} = 0,\]</div>
<p>at the right boundary <span class="math">\(x=x_R\)</span>. The parameter <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is the wave velocity,
which for the model in <a class="reference internal" href="main_wave.html#wave-app-exer-tsunami1d"><em>Exercise 17: Earthquake-generated tsunami in a 1D model</em></a>
is <span class="math">\(c=\sqrt{gH(x_R)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Show that <a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:radiation:eq">(1)</a> accepts
a solution <span class="math">\(\eta = g_R(x-ct)\)</span>, but not <span class="math">\(\eta = g_L(x+ct)\)</span>. This means
that <a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:radiation:eq">(1)</a> will allow any
right-going wave <span class="math">\(g_R(x-ct)\)</span> pass through the boundary.</p>
<p>The condition <a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:radiation:eq">(1)</a> can be
discretized by centered differences at the spatial end point <span class="math">\(i=N_x\)</span>,
corresponding to <span class="math">\(x=x_R\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:radiation:eq:op">
<span class="eqno">(2)</span>\[     [D_{2t}\eta + cD_{2x}\eta =0]^n_{N_x}\]\[     \thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Eliminate the fictitious value <span class="math">\(\eta_{N_x+1}^n\)</span> by using
the discrete equation at the same point <span class="math">\((n,N_x)\)</span>.
The equation for the first step, <span class="math">\(\eta_i^1\)</span>, is in principal affected,
but we can then use the condition <span class="math">\(\eta^1_{N_x}=0\)</span> since the wave
has not yet reached the right boundary.</p>
<p>Modify the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">solver</span></tt> function in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wave1D.py</span></tt> program to
incorporate the condition <a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:radiation:eq:op">(2)</a>.
Demonstrate that the tsunami travels through the domain and out of
the right boundary without leaving any reflections behind.
Make a nose test for checking that after a certain time <span class="math">\(T\)</span>, the surface is
flat.</p>
<p><em>Remark 1.</em> The condition <a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:radiation:eq">(1)</a>
works perfectly in 1D when <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is known. In 2D and 3D, however, the
condition reads <span class="math">\(\eta_t + c_x\eta_x + c_y\eta_y=0\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(c_x\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(c_y\)</span> are the wave speeds in the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> directions, and estimating
these components (i.e., the direction of the wave) is often
challenging. Other methods are normally used in 2D and 3D to
let waves move out of a computational domain.</p>
<p><em>Remark 2.</em> A radiation or open boundary condition at the left
boundary takes the same form as <a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:radiation:eq">(1)</a>,
except that there is a minus sign in front of the <span class="math">\(c\eta_x\)</span>
term. One can easily show that with this sign, the condition accepts
left-going waves of the form <span class="math">\(\eta = g_L(x+ct)\)</span>.

<p>This exercise extends <a class="reference internal" href="main_wave.html#wave-app-exer-tsunami1d-hill"><em>Exercise 19: Earthquake-generated tsunami over a subsea hill</em></a>
to a three-dimensional wave phenomenon, governed by the 2D PDE
<a href="#equation-wave:app:sw:2D:eta:2ndoeq">(?)</a>. We assume that the earthquake
arise from a fault along the line <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span> in the <span class="math">\(xy\)</span>-plane so that
the initial lift of the surface can be taken as <span class="math">\(I(x)\)</span> in

propagating to the right, but will experience bending because of
the bottom.</p>
<p>The bottom shape is now a function of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>.
An &#8220;elliptic&#8221; Gauss function in two dimensions, with its peak

<p>and <span class="math">\(B=B_0\)</span> outside this rectangle.
The <span class="math">\(b\)</span> parameter controls the rectangular shape of the cross section of
the box.</p>
<p>Note that the initial condition and the listed bottom shapes are
symmetric around the line <span class="math">\(y=B_{my}\)</span>. We therefore expect the
surface elevation also to be symmetric with respect to this line.
This means that we can halve the computational domain by working
with  <span class="math">\([0,L_x]\times [0, B_{my}]\)</span>. Along the upper boundary, <span class="math">\(y=B_{my}\)</span>,
we must impose the symmetry condition <span class="math">\(\partial \eta/\partial n=0\)</span>.
Such a symmetry condition (<span class="math">\(-\eta_x=0\)</span>)
is also needed at the <span class="math">\(x=0\)</span> boundary because
the initial condition has a symmetry here. At the lower boundary
<span class="math">\(y=0\)</span> we also set a Neumann condition (which becomes <span class="math">\(-\eta_y=0\)</span>).
At the right boundary <span class="math">\(x=L_x\)</span>
one can either implement a radiation (or open boundary) condition
as in <a class="reference internal" href="main_wave.html#wave-app-exer-tsunami1d-radiation"><em>Exercise 18: Implement an open boundary condition</em></a> or just set
<span class="math">\(\eta = 0\)</span> or use a reflecting condition <span class="math">\(\partial\eta/\partial n

<p>Visualize the surface elevation.  Investigate how different hill shapes,
different sizes of the water gap above the hill, and different
resolutions <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> influence
the numerical quality of the solution.

Introduce <span class="math">\(m\)</span> horizontal layers of thickness <span class="math">\(h_i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(i=0,\ldots,m-1\)</span>.
Inside layer number <span class="math">\(i\)</span> we have a vertical wave velocity <span class="math">\(c_{z,i}\)</span>
and a horizontal wave velocity <span class="math">\(c_{h,i}\)</span>. Make a program

<p>The equation for sound waves in air is derived in the section <a class="reference internal" href="main_wave.html#wave-app-sound"><em>Sound waves in liquids and gases</em></a>
and reads</p>
<div class="math">
\[p_{tt} = c^2\nabla^2 p,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(p(x,y,z,t)\)</span> is the pressure and <span class="math">\(c\)</span>
is the speed of sound, taken as 340 m/s.</p>
<p>However, sound is absorbed in the air due to relaxation of molecules
in the gas. A model for simple relaxation, valid for gases consisting
only of one type of molecules, is a term <span class="math">\(c^2\tau_s\nabla^2 p_t\)</span> in
the PDE, where <span class="math">\(\tau_s\)</span> is the relaxation time. If we generate sound
from, e.g., a loudspeaker in the room, this sound source must also
be added to the governing equation.</p>
<p>The PDE with the mentioned type of damping and source then becomes</p>
<div class="math">
\[p_tt = c^2\nabla^p + c^2\tau_s\nabla^2 p_t + f,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(f(x,y,z,t)\)</span> is the source term.</p>
<p>The walls can absorb some sound. A possible model is to have a &#8220;wall layer&#8221;
(thicker than the physical wall)
outside the room where <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is changed such that some of the wave energy
is reflected and some is absorbed in the wall. The absorption of
energy can be taken care of by adding a damping term <span class="math">\(bp_t\)</span> in
the equation:</p>
<div class="math">
\[p_tt + bp_t = c^2\nabla^p + c^2\tau_s\nabla^2 p_t + f{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Typically, <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span> in the room and <span class="math">\(b&gt;0\)</span> in the wall. A discontinuity in <span class="math">\(b\)</span>
or <span class="math">\(c\)</span> will give rise to reflections. It can be wise to use a constant
<span class="math">\(c\)</span> in the wall to control reflections because of the discontinuity between
<span class="math">\(c\)</span> in the air and in the wall, while <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is gradually increased
as we go into the wall to avoid reflections because of rapid changes in <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.
At the outer boundary of the wall the condition <span class="math">\(p=0\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\partial p/\partial n=0\)</span> can be imposed. The waves should anyway be approximately dampened
to <span class="math">\(p=0\)</span> this far out in the wall layer.</p>
<p>There are two strategies for discretizing the <span class="math">\(\nabla^2 p_t\)</span> term: using
a center difference between times <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> (if the equation is
sampled at level <span class="math">\(n\)</span>), or use a one-sided difference based on levels <span class="math">\(n\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span>. The latter has the advantage of not leading to any equation system,
while the former is second-order accurate as the scheme for the
simple wave equation <span class="math">\(p_tt = c^2\nabla^2 p\)</span>. To avoid an equation system,
go for the one-sided difference such that the overall scheme becomes
explicit and only of first order in time.</p>
<p>Develop a 3D solver for the specified PDE and introduce a wall layer.
Test the solver with the method of manufactured solutions. Make some
demonstrations where the wall reflects and absorbs the waves (reflection
because of discontinuity in <span class="math">\(b\)</span> and absorption because of growing <span class="math">\(b\)</span>).
Experiment with the impact of the <span class="math">\(\tau_s\)</span> parameter.

<p><em>Physical interpretation.</em> The parameter <span class="math">\(c\)</span> can be constant or variable, <span class="math">\(c=c(x)\)</span>. The
equation <a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:advec1D:ueq">(10)</a> arises in <em>transport</em>
problems where a quantity <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, which could be temperature or

heat conduction or Fickian diffusion), but we have in
the model <span class="math">\(u_t + cu_x\)</span> assumed that diffusion effects are negligible,
which they often are.</p>

<p>The inverse function computation can be easily done if we first think

Plotting <span class="math">\((x_i,y_i)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(y_i=g(x_i)\)</span> for some mesh points <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span>,
displays <span class="math">\(g\)</span> as a function of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.
The inverse function is simply <span class="math">\(x\)</span> as a function of <span class="math">\(g\)</span>, i.e., the
curve with points <span class="math">\((y_i,x_i)\)</span>. We can therefore quickly compute points
at the curve of the inverse function. One way of extending these
points to a continuous function is to assume a linear variation
(known as linear interpolation)
between the points (which actually means to draw straight lines between
the points, exactly as done by a plotting program).</p>

<span class="eqno">(14)</span>\[      I(x) = \left\lbrack\sin\left(\pi\frac{x}{L}\right)\right\rbrack^{2n}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is an integer, typically <span class="math">\(n=5\)</span>,
and</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:exer:advec1D:I:gauss">
<span class="eqno">(15)</span>\[     I(x) = \exp{\left( -\frac{(x-L/2)^2}{2\sigma2}\right)} \thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Choose <span class="math">\(\Delta t = c^{-1}\Delta x, 0.9c^{-1}\Delta x, 0.5c^{-1}\Delta x\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>e)</em> The performance of the suggested numerical scheme can be investigated
by analyzing the numerical dispersion relation.
Analytically, we have that the <em>Fourier component</em></p>
<div class="math">
\[u(x,t) = e^{i(kx-\omega t)},\]</div>
<p>is a solution of the PDE if <span class="math">\(\omega = kc\)</span>. This is the <em>analytical
dispersion relation</em>. A complete solution of the PDE can be built by
adding up such Fourier components with different amplitudes, where the
initial condition <span class="math">\(I\)</span> determines the amplitudes. The solution <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is
then represented by a Fourier series.</p>
<p>A similar discrete Fourier component at <span class="math">\((x_p,t_n)\)</span> is</p>
<div class="math">
\[u_p^q = e^{i(kp\Delta x -\tilde\omega n\Delta t)},\]</div>
<p>where in general <span class="math">\(\tilde\omega\)</span> is a function of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>, and
<span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span>, and differs from the exact <span class="math">\(\omega =kc\)</span>.</p>
<p>Insert the discrete Fourier component in the numerical scheme and
derive an expression for <span class="math">\(\tilde\omega\)</span>, i.e.,
the discrete dispersion relation. Show in particular that if
the <span class="math">\(\Delta t/(c\Delta x)=1\)</span>, the discrete solution coincides with the
exact solution at the mesh points, regardless of the mesh resolution (!).
Show that if the stability condition</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\Delta t}{c\Delta x}\leq 1,\]</div>
<p>the discrete Fourier component cannot grow (i.e., <span class="math">\(\tilde\omega\)</span> is real).</p>
<p><em>f)</em> Write a test for your implementation where you try to use information
from the numerical dispersion relation.</p>
<p><em>g)</em> Set up a computational algorithm for the variable
coefficient case and implement it in a function.
Make a test that the function works for constant <span class="math">\(a\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>h)</em> It can be shown that
for an observer moving with velocity <span class="math">\(c(x)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is constant.
This can be used to derive an exact solution when <span class="math">\(a\)</span> varies
with <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. Show first that</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:exer:advec1D:u:avar:sol">
<span class="eqno">(16)</span>\[     u(x,t) = f(C(x) - t),\]</div>
<p>where</p>
<div class="math">
\[C'(x) = \frac{1}{c(x)},\]</div>
<p>is a solution of <a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:advec1D:ueq">(10)</a> for any
differentiable function <span class="math">\(f\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Solution.</em> Let <span class="math">\(\xi = C(x) - t\)</span>.
We have that</p>
<div class="math">
\[u_t = f'(\xi)(-1),\]</div>
<p>while</p>
<div class="math">
\[u_x = f'(\xi)C'(x) = f'(\xi)\frac{1}{c(x)},\]</div>
<p>implying that <span class="math">\(au_x = f'(\xi)\)</span>. Then we have <span class="math">\(u_t + cu_x= -f'(\xi) +
f'(\xi) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>i)</em> Use the initial condition to show that an exact solution is</p>
<div class="math">
\[u(x,t) = I(C^{-1}(C(x)-t)),\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math">\(C^{-1}\)</span> being the inverse function of <span class="math">\(C = \int c^{1}dx\)</span>.
Since <span class="math">\(C(x)\)</span> is an integral <span class="math">\(\int_0^x (1/c)dx\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(C(x)\)</span> is monotonically increasing and there exists hence an
inverse function <span class="math">\(C^{-1}\)</span> with values in <span class="math">\([0,L]\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Solution.</em> In general we have <span class="math">\(u(x,t) = f(C(x)-t)\)</span> and the solution is
of this form with <span class="math">\(f(\xi)=I(C^{-1}(\xi))\)</span>.
Moreover, at <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span> we have
<span class="math">\(I(C^{-1}(C(x)))=I(x)\)</span>, which is the required initial condition.</p>
<p><em>j)</em> Implement a function for computing <span class="math">\(C(x_i)\)</span> and one for computing
<span class="math">\(C^{-1}(x)\)</span> for any <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. Use these two functions for computing
the exact solution <span class="math">\(I(C^{-1}(C(x)-t))\)</span>.
End up with a function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">u_exact_variable_c(x,</span> <span class="pre">n,</span> <span class="pre">c,</span> <span class="pre">I)</span></tt> that returns
the value of <span class="math">\(I(C^{-1}(C(x)-t_n))\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>k)</em> Make movies showing a comparison of the numerical and exact solutions
for the two initial conditions
<a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:advec1D:I:sin">(14)</a> and <a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:advec1D:I:gauss">(15)</a>.
Choose <span class="math">\(\Delta t = \Delta x /\max_{0,L} c(x)\)</span>
and the velocity of the medium as</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><span class="math">\(c(x) = 1 + \epsilon\sin(k\pi x/L)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\epsilon &lt;1\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math">\(c(x) = 1 + I(x)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(I\)</span> is given by
<a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:advec1D:I:sin">(14)</a> or <a href="#equation-wave:app:exer:advec1D:I:gauss">(15)</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The PDE <span class="math">\(u_t + cu_x=0\)</span> expresses that the initial condition <span class="math">\(I(x)\)</span>
is transported with velocity <span class="math">\(c(x)\)</span>.</p>
