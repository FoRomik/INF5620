.. _wave:app:blood:

Waves in blood vessels
----------------------

The flow of blood in our bodies is basically fluid flow in
a network of pipes. Unlike rigid pipes, the walls in the
blood vessels are elastic and will increase their diameter when the
pressure rises. The elastic forces will then push the wall back
and accelerate the fluid. This interaction between the flow of blood
and the deformation of the vessel wall results in waves traveling along
our blood vessels.

A model for one-dimensional waves along blood vessels can be derived
from averaging the fluid flow over the cross section of the blood
vessels. Let :math:`x` be a coordinate along the blood vessel and assume
that all cross sections are circular, though with different radius :math:`R(x,t)`.
The main quantities to compute is the cross section
area :math:`A(x,t)`, the averaged pressure :math:`P(x,t)`, and the total volume
flux :math:`Q(x,t)`.
The area of this cross section
is


.. math::
        
        A(x,t) = 2\pi\int_{0}^{R(x,t)} rdr,
        

Let :math:`v_x(x,t)` be the velocity of blood averaged over
the cross section at point :math:`x`. The volume flux,
being the total volume of blood passing a cross section per time unit,
becomes

.. math::
        
        Q(x,t) = A(x,t)v_x(x,t)
        \thinspace
        


Mass balance and Newton's second law lead to the PDEs


.. _Eq:wave:app:blood:cont:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:blood:cont
        
        \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = 0,
        
        



.. _Eq:wave:app:blood:mom:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:blood:mom
          
        \frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} +
        \frac{\gamma+2}{\gamma + 1}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{Q^2}{A}\right)
        + \frac{A}{\varrho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}
        = -2\pi (\gamma + 2)\frac{\mu}{\varrho}\frac{Q}{A},
        
        

where :math:`\gamma` is a parameter related to the velocity profile,
:math:`\varrho` is the density of blood, and :math:`\mu` is the dynamic viscosity
of blood.

We have three unknowns :math:`A`, :math:`Q`, and :math:`P`, and two equations
:eq:`wave:app:blood:cont` and :eq:`wave:app:blood:mom`.
A third equation is needed to relate the flow to
the deformations of the wall. A common form for this equation is


.. _Eq:wave:app:blood:const:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:blood:const
        
        \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{C}
        \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} =0,
        
        

where :math:`C` is the compliance of the wall, given by the constitutive
relation


.. math::
        
        C = \frac{\partial A}{\partial P} + \frac{\partial A}{\partial t},
        

which require a relationship between :math:`A` and :math:`P`. One common model
is to view the vessel wall, locally, as a thin elastic tube subject to an
internal pressure. This gives the relation


.. math::
         P=P_0 + \frac{\pi h E}{(1-\nu^2)A_0}(\sqrt{A} - \sqrt{A_0}),
        

where :math:`P_0` and :math:`A_0` are corresponding reference values when the
wall is not deformed, :math:`h` is the
thickness of the wall, and :math:`E` and :math:`\nu` are Young's modulus and
Poisson's ratio of the elastic material in the wall.
The derivative becomes


.. math::
        
        C = \frac{\partial A}{\partial P} =
        \frac{2(1-\nu^2)A_0}{\pi h E}\sqrt{A_0} +
        2\left(\frac{(1-\nu^2)A_0}{\pi h E}\right)^2(P-P_0)
        {\thinspace .} 
        

Another (nonlinear) deformation model of the wall, which has a better
fit with experiments, is


.. math::
         P = P_0\exp{(\beta (A/A_0 - 1))},

where :math:`\beta` is some parameter to be estimated. This law leads to


.. math::
        
        C = \frac{\partial A}{\partial P} = \frac{A_0}{\beta P}
        {\thinspace .} 
        


*Reduction to standard wave equation.* It is not uncommon to neglect the viscous term on the right-hand side of
:eq:`wave:app:blood:mom` and also the quadratic term
with :math:`Q^2` on the left-hand side. The reduced equations
:eq:`wave:app:blood:mom`
and :eq:`wave:app:blood:const` form a first-order
linear wave equation system:


.. math::
        
        C\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x},
        



.. math::
          
        \frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}
        = - \frac{A}{\varrho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}
        {\thinspace .} 
        

These can be combined into standard 1D wave equation PDE by differentiating
the first equation with respect :math:`t` and the second with respect to :math:`x`,

.. math::
         \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( CC\frac{\partial P}{\partial t}
        \right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(
        \frac{A}{\varrho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}\right),

which can be approximated by

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial^2 Q}{\partial t^2} = c^2\frac{\partial^2 Q}{\partial x^2},\quad
        c = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\varrho C}},
        

where the :math:`A` and :math:`C` in the expression for :math:`c` are taken as constant
reference values.

.. _wave:app:light:

Electromagnetic waves
---------------------

Light and radio waves are governed by standard wave equations arising
from Maxwell's general equations. When there are no charges and
no currents, as in a vacuum, Maxwell's equations take the form


.. math::
        
        \nabla\cdot\pmb{E} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\cdot\pmb{B} &= 0,\\ 
        \nabla\times\pmb{E} &= -\frac{\partial\pmb{B}}{\partial t},\\ 
        \nabla\times\pmb{B} &= \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\pmb{E}}{\partial t},
        

where :math:`\epsilon_0=8.854187817620\cdot 10^{-12}` (F/m)
is the permittivity of free space, also known as the
electric constant, and :math:`\mu_0=1.2566370614\cdot 10^{-6}` (H/m)
is the permeability of free space,
also known as the magnetic constant.
Taking the curl of the two last equations and using the
identity

.. math::
         \nabla\times (\nabla\times \pmb{E}) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \pmb{E})
        - \nabla^2\pmb{E} = - \nabla^2\pmb{E}\hbox{ when }\nabla\cdot\pmb{E}=0,
        

immediately gives the wave equation governing the electric and magnetic field:

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial^2\pmb{E}}{\partial t^2} =
        c^2\frac{\partial^2\pmb{E}}{\partial x^2},
        



.. math::
          
        \frac{\partial^2\pmb{E}}{\partial t^2} =
        c^2\frac{\partial^2\pmb{E}}{\partial x^2},
        

with :math:`c=1/\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}` as the velocity of light.
Each component of :math:`\pmb{E}` and :math:`\pmb{B}` fulfills a wave equation
and can hence be solved independently.

.. _wave:app:exer:string:discont:

Exercise 14: Simulate waves on a non-homogeneous string
-------------------------------------------------------

Simulate waves on a string that consists of two materials with
different density. The tension in the string is constant, but the
density has a jump at the middle of the string.  Experiment with
different sizes of the jump and produce animations that visualize the
effect of the jump on the wave motion.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---


*Hint.* According to the section :ref:`wave:app:string`,
the density enters the mathematical model as :math:`\varrho` in
:math:`\varrho u_{tt} = Tu_{xx}`, where :math:`T` is the string tension. Modify, e.g., the
``wave1D_u0_sv.py`` code to incorporate the tension and two density values.
Make a mesh function ``rho`` with density values at each spatial mesh point.
A value for the tension may be 150 N. Corresponding density values can
be computed from the wave velocity estimations in the ``guitar`` function
in the ``wave1D_u0_sv.py`` file.

Formulate a mathematical model for damped waves on a string.

tune the damping parameter so that the string is very close to
the rest state after 15 s. Make a movie of the wave motion.

.. _wave:app:exer:rod:

Exercise 16: Simulate elastic waves in a rod
--------------------------------------------

A hammer hits the end of an elastic rod. The exercise is to simulate
the resulting wave motion using the model :ref:`(8.8) <Eq:wave:app:elastic:rod:eq>`
from the section :ref:`wave:app:elastic:rod`. Let the rod have length
:math:`L` and let the boundary :math:`x=L` be stress free so that :math:`\sigma_{xx}=0`,
implying that :math:`\partial u/\partial x=0`. The left end :math:`x=0` is
subject to a strong stress pulse (the hammer), modeled as


.. math::
         \sigma_{xx}(t) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        S,& 0 < t \leq t_s,\\ 
        0, & t > t_s
        \end{array}\right.
        

The corresponding condition on :math:`u` becomes :math:`u_x= S/E`
for :math:`t\leq t_s` and zero afterwards (recall that
:math:`\sigma_{xx} = Eu_x`). This is a non-homogeneous
Neumann condition, and you will need to approximate this condition
and combine it with the scheme (the ideas and manipulations follow
closely the handling of a non-zero initial condition
:math:`u_t=V` in wave PDEs or the corresponding
second-order ODEs for vibrations).

.. _wave:app:exer:spherical:

Exercise 17: Simulate spherical waves
-------------------------------------

Implement a model for spherically symmetric waves using the method
described in the section :ref:`wave:app:spherical`. The boundary condition
at :math:`r=0` must be :math:`\partial u/\partial r=0`, while the condition at
:math:`r=R` can either be :math:`u=0` or a radiation condition as described
in :ref:`wave:app:exer:radiationBC`. The :math:`u=0` condition is
sufficient if :math:`R` is so large that the amplitude of the spherical
wave has become insignificant. Make movie(s) of the case where the source
term is located around :math:`r=0` and sends out pulses


.. math::
         f(r,t) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        Q\exp{(-\frac{r^2}{2\Delta r^2})}\sin\omega t,& \sin\omega t\geq 0\\ 
        0, & \sin\omega t < 0
        \end{array}\right.
        

Here, :math:`Q` and :math:`\omega` are constants to be chosen.

*Hint.* Use the program ``wave1D_u0_sv.py`` as a starting point. Let ``solver``
compute the :math:`v` function and then set :math:`u=v/r`. However,
:math:`u=v/r` for :math:`r=0` requires special treatment. One possibility is
to compute ``u[1:] = v[1:]/r[1:]`` and then set ``u[0]=u[1]``. The latter
makes it evident that :math:`\partial u/\partial r = 0` in a plot.

pulse. The noise is much less visible for a Gaussian pulse. Run the
case with the plug and half a "cosinehat" pulses for :math:`s_f=1`, :math:`C=0.9,

.. _wave:app:exer:radiationBC:

Problem 20: Implement open boundary conditions
----------------------------------------------


.. index:: radiation condition


.. index:: open boundary condition


To enable a wave to leave the computational domain and travel
undisturbed through
the boundary :math:`x=L`, one can in a one-dimensional problem impose the
following condition, called a *radiation condition* or
*open boundary condition*:


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq
        
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0{\thinspace .}
        
        

The parameter :math:`c` is the wave velocity.

Show that :eq:`wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq` accepts
a solution :math:`u = g_R(x-ct)`, but not :math:`u = g_L(x+ct)`. This means
that :eq:`wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq` will allow any
right-going wave :math:`g_R(x-ct)` to pass through the boundary.

A corresponding open boundary condition for a left-going wave
through :math:`x=0` is


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eqL:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eqL
        
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0{\thinspace .}
        
        


The condition :eq:`wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq`
can be
discretized by centered differences at the spatial end point :math:`i=N_x`,
corresponding to :math:`x=x_R`:


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq:op:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq:op
        
        [D_{2t}u + cD_{2x}u =0]^n_{N_x}
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

Eliminate the fictitious value :math:`u_{N_x+1}^n` by using
the discrete equation at the same point.
The equation for the first step, :math:`u_i^1`, is in principal affected,
but we can then use the condition :math:`u_{N_x}=0` since the wave
has not yet reached the right boundary.

A corresponding open boundary condition for a left-going wave
through :math:`x=0` is


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq:opL:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq:opL
        
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - c\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0{\thinspace .}
        
        

Implement a solver that incorporates the conditions
:eq:`wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq:op` and
:eq:`wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq:opL`.  Start with some
peak-shaped Gaussian function in the middle of the domain as :math:`I(x)`
and demonstrate that waves travel undisturbed out of the domain at
:math:`x=L` and :math:`x=0`.  Make a nose test for checking that the surface is
flat after a certain time.

*Remark.* The condition :eq:`wave:app:exer:radiationBC:eq`
works perfectly in 1D when :math:`c` is known. In 2D and 3D, however, the
condition reads :math:`u_t + c_x u_x + c_y u_y=0`, where :math:`c_x` and
:math:`c_y` are the wave speeds in the :math:`x` and :math:`y` directions. Estimating
these components (i.e., the direction of the wave) is often
challenging. Other methods are normally used in 2D and 3D to
let waves move out of a computational domain.

.. _wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill:

Problem 21: Earthquake-generated tsunami over a subsea hill
-----------------------------------------------------------

A subsea earthquake leads to an immediate lift of the water surface, see
Figure :ref:`wave:app:fig:1D:tsunami:flat`.  The lifted water surface
splits into two
tsunamis, one traveling to the right and one to the left, as depicted
in Figure :ref:`wave:app:fig:1D:tsunami:2waves`.  Since tsunamis are
normally very long waves, compared to the depth, with a small
amplitude, compared to the wave length, the wave equation model
described in the section :ref:`wave:app:sw:2D` is relevant:


.. math::
         \eta_{tt} = (gH(x)\eta_x)_x,

where :math:`g` is the acceleration of gravity, and :math:`H(x)` is the still water depth.


.. _wave:app:fig:1D:tsunami:flat:

   :width: 800

   *Sketch of initial water surface due to a subsea earthquake*



.. _wave:app:fig:1D:tsunami:2waves:

.. figure:: fig-wave/earthquake_tsunami_2waves.png
   :width: 800

   *An initial surface elevation is split into two waves*



To simulate the right-going tsunami, we can impose
a symmetry boundary at :math:`x=0`: :math:`\partial\eta\ \partial x =0`.
We then simulate the wave motion
in :math:`[0,L]`. Unless the ocean ends at :math:`x=L`, the waves should travel
undisturbed through the boundary :math:`x=L`. A radiation condition
as explained in :ref:`wave:app:exer:radiationBC` can be
used for this purpose. Alternatively, one can just stop the simulations
before the wave hits the boundary at :math:`x=L`. In that case it does not
matter what kind of boundary condition we use
at :math:`x=L`. Imposing :math:`\eta =0` and stopping the simulations when
:math:`|\eta_i^n| > \epsilon`, :math:`i=N_x-1`, is a possibility (:math:`\epsilon` is a
small parameter).

The shape of the initial surface can be taken as a
Gaussian function,


.. math::
        
        I(x;I_0,I_a,I_m,I_s) =
        I_0 + I_a\exp{\left(-\left(\frac{x-I_m}{I_s}\right)^2\right)},
        

with :math:`I_m=0` reflecting the location of the peak of :math:`I(x)` and
:math:`I_s` being a measure of the width of the function :math:`I(x)`
(:math:`I_s` is :math:`\sqrt{2}` times the standard deviation of the familiar
normal distribution curve).

Now we extend the problem with a hill at the sea
bottom, see Figure :ref:`wave:app:fig:1D:tsunami:hill`. The wave speed
:math:`c=\sqrt{gH(x)} = \sqrt{g(H_0-B(x))}` will then be reduced in the
shallow water above the hill.

   *Sketch of an earthquake-generated tsunami passing over a subsea hill*


One possible form of the
hill is a Gaussian function,


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill:Gauss:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill:Gauss
        
        B(x;B_0,B_a,B_m,B_s) =
        B_0 + B_a\exp{\left(-\left(\frac{x-B_m}{B_s}\right)^2\right)},
        
        

but many other shapes are also possible, e.g., a "cosine hat" where


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill:cohat:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill:cohat
        
        B(x; B_0, B_a, B_m, B_s) = B_0 + B_a\cos{\left( \pi\frac{x-B_m}{2B_s}\right)},
        
        

when :math:`x\in [B_m - B_s, B_m + B_s]` while :math:`B=B_0` outside this
interval.

Also an abrupt construction may be tried:

.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill:box:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill:box
        
        B(x; B_0, B_a, B_m, B_s) = B_0 + B_a,
        
        

for :math:`x\in [B_m - B_s, B_m + B_s]` while :math:`B=B_0` outside this
interval.

The `wave1D_dn_vc.py <http://tinyurl.com/jvzzcfn/wave/wave1D/wave1D_dn_vc.py>`_
program can be used as starting point for the implementation.
Visualize both the bottom topography and the
water surface elevation in
the same plot.
Allow for a flexible choice of bottom shape:
:eq:`wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill:Gauss`,
:eq:`wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill:cohat`,
:eq:`wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill:box`, or :math:`B(x)=B_0` (flat).

The purpose of this problem is to explore the quality of the numerical
solution :math:`\eta^n_i` for different shapes of the bottom obstruction.
The "cosine hat" and the box-shaped hills have abrupt changes in the
derivative of :math:`H(x)` and are more likely to generate numerical noise
than the smooth Gaussian shape of the hill. Investigate if this is true.

Problem 22: Earthquake-generated tsunami over a 3D hill
-------------------------------------------------------

This problem extends :ref:`wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill`
to a three-dimensional wave phenomenon, governed by the 2D PDE
:ref:`(9.5) <Eq:wave:app:sw:2D:eta:2ndoeq>`. We assume that the earthquake
arise from a fault along the line :math:`x=0` in the :math:`xy`-plane so that
the initial lift of the surface can be taken as :math:`I(x)` in
:ref:`wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill`. That is, a plane wave is
propagating to the right, but will experience bending because of
the bottom.

The bottom shape is now a function of :math:`x` and :math:`y`.
An "elliptic" Gaussian function in two dimensions, with its peak
at :math:`(B_{mx}, B_{my})`, generalizes
:eq:`wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill:Gauss`:


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:tsunami2D:hill:Gauss:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:tsunami2D:hill:Gauss
        
        B(x;B_0,B_a,B_{mx}, B_{my} ,B_s, b) =
        B_0 + B_a\exp{\left(-\left(\frac{x-B_{mx}}{B_s}\right)^2
        -\left(\frac{y-B_{my}}{bB_s}\right)^2\right)},
        
        

where :math:`b` is a scaling parameter: :math:`b=1` gives a circular Gaussian
function with circular contour lines, while :math:`b\neq 1` gives an elliptic
shape with elliptic contour lines.

The "cosine hat" :eq:`wave:app:exer:tsunami1D:hill:cohat` can also be
generalized to


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:tsunami2D:hill:cohat:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:tsunami2D:hill:cohat
        
        B(x; B_0, B_a, B_{mx}, B_{my}, B_s) =
        B_0 + B_a\cos{\left( \pi\frac{x-B_{mx}}{2B_s}\right)}
        \cos{\left( \pi\frac{y-B_{my}}{2B_s}\right)},
        
        

when :math:`0 \leq \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \leq B_s` and :math:`B=B_0` outside this circle.

A box-shaped obstacle means that

.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:tsunami2D:hill:box:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:tsunami2D:hill:box
        
        B(x; B_0, B_a, B_m, B_s, b) = B_0 + B_a
        
        

for :math:`x` and :math:`y` inside a rectangle

.. math::
         B_{mx}-B_s \leq  x \leq B_{mx} + B_s,\quad
        B_{my}-bB_s \leq  y \leq B_{my} + bB_s,
        

and :math:`B=B_0` outside this rectangle.
The :math:`b` parameter controls the rectangular shape of the cross section of
the box.

Note that the initial condition and the listed bottom shapes are
symmetric around the line :math:`y=B_{my}`. We therefore expect the surface
elevation also to be symmetric with respect to this line.  This means
that we can halve the computational domain by working with
:math:`[0,L_x]\times [0, B_{my}]`. Along the upper boundary, :math:`y=B_{my}`, we
must impose the symmetry condition :math:`\partial \eta/\partial n=0`.  Such
a symmetry condition (:math:`-\eta_x=0`) is also needed at the :math:`x=0`
boundary because the initial condition has a symmetry here. At the
lower boundary :math:`y=0` we also set a Neumann condition (which becomes
:math:`-\eta_y=0`).  The wave motion is to be simulated until the wave hits
the reflecting boundaries where :math:`\partial\eta/\partial n =\eta_x =0`
(one can also set :math:`\eta =0` - the particular condition does not matter
as long as the simulation is stopped before the wave is influenced
by the boundary condition).

Visualize the surface elevation.  Investigate how different hill shapes,
different sizes of the water gap above the hill, and different
resolutions :math:`\Delta x = \Delta y = h` and :math:`\Delta t` influence
the numerical quality of the solution.

Exercise 26: Simulate seismic waves in 2D
-----------------------------------------

The goal of this exercise is to simulate seismic waves using the
PDE model :ref:`(8.16) <Eq:wave:app:acoustic:seismic:accoustic1a>` in a
2D :math:`xz` domain with geological layers.
Introduce :math:`m` horizontal layers of thickness :math:`h_i`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,m-1`.
Inside layer number :math:`i` we have a vertical wave velocity :math:`c_{z,i}`
and a horizontal wave velocity :math:`c_{h,i}`. Make a program
for simulating such 2D waves. Test it on a case with 3 layers where


.. math::
         c_{z,0}=c_{z,1}=c_{z,2},\quad c_{h,0}=c_{h,2},\quad c_{h,1} \ll c_{h,0}
        {\thinspace .}
        

Let :math:`s` be a localized point source at the middle of the Earth's surface
(the upper boundary)
and investigate how the resulting wave travels through the medium.
The source can be a localized Gaussian peak that oscillates in
time for some time interval.
Place the boundaries far enough from the expanding wave so that the
boundary conditions do not disturb the wave. Then the type of
boundary condition does not matter, except that we physically need
to have :math:`p=p_0`, where :math:`p_0` is the atmospheric pressure,
at the upper boundary.

.. _wave:app:exer:acoustics:

Project 27: Model 3D acoustic waves in a room
---------------------------------------------

The equation for sound waves in air is derived in the section :ref:`wave:app:sound`
and reads


.. math::
         p_{tt} = c^2\nabla^2 p,

where :math:`p(x,y,z,t)` is the pressure and :math:`c`
is the speed of sound, taken as 340 m/s.

.. air at a room temperature 20 C, :math:`p_0` is reference pressure in the

.. air, typically 1 atm (approximately :math:`10^5` Pa), and :math:`\varrho_0` is

.. the density of air, taken as :math:`1.225\mbox{ kg/m}^3`.

However, sound is absorbed in the air due to relaxation of molecules
in the gas. A model for simple relaxation, valid for gases consisting
only of one type of molecules, is a term :math:`c^2\tau_s\nabla^2 p_t` in
the PDE, where :math:`\tau_s` is the relaxation time. If we generate sound
from, e.g., a loudspeaker in the room, this sound source must also
be added to the governing equation.

The PDE with the mentioned type of damping and source then becomes


.. math::
        
        p_tt = c^2\nabla^p + c^2\tau_s\nabla^2 p_t + f,
        

where :math:`f(x,y,z,t)` is the source term.

The walls can absorb some sound. A possible model is to have a "wall layer"
(thicker than the physical wall)
outside the room where :math:`c` is changed such that some of the wave energy
is reflected and some is absorbed in the wall. The absorption of
energy can be taken care of by adding a damping term :math:`bp_t` in
the equation:


.. math::
        
        p_tt + bp_t = c^2\nabla^p + c^2\tau_s\nabla^2 p_t + f{\thinspace .}
        

Typically, :math:`b=0` in the room and :math:`b>0` in the wall. A discontinuity in :math:`b`
or :math:`c` will give rise to reflections. It can be wise to use a constant
:math:`c` in the wall to control reflections because of the discontinuity between
:math:`c` in the air and in the wall, while :math:`b` is gradually increased
as we go into the wall to avoid reflections because of rapid changes in :math:`b`.
At the outer boundary of the wall the condition :math:`p=0` or :math:`\partial p/\partial n=0` can be imposed. The waves should anyway be approximately dampened
to :math:`p=0` this far out in the wall layer.

There are two strategies for discretizing the :math:`\nabla^2 p_t` term: using
a center difference between times :math:`n+1` and :math:`n-1` (if the equation is
sampled at level :math:`n`), or use a one-sided difference based on levels :math:`n`
and :math:`n-1`. The latter has the advantage of not leading to any equation system,
while the former is second-order accurate as the scheme for the
simple wave equation :math:`p_tt = c^2\nabla^2 p`. To avoid an equation system,
go for the one-sided difference such that the overall scheme becomes
explicit and only of first order in time.

Develop a 3D solver for the specified PDE and introduce a wall layer.
Test the solver with the method of manufactured solutions. Make some
demonstrations where the wall reflects and absorbs the waves (reflection
because of discontinuity in :math:`b` and absorption because of growing :math:`b`).
Experiment with the impact of the :math:`\tau_s` parameter.

.. _wave:app:exer:advec1D:

Project 28: Solve a 1D transport equation
-----------------------------------------

We shall study the wave equation


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:advec1D:ueq:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:advec1D:ueq
        
        u_t + cu_x = 0,\quad x\in (0,L],\ t\in (0, T],
        
        

with initial condition


.. math::
        
        u(x,0) = I(x),\quad x\in [0,L],
        

and *one* periodic boundary condition


.. math::
        
        u(0,t) = u(L,t)
        {\thinspace .}
        

This boundary condition means that what goes out of the domain at :math:`x=L`
comes in at :math:`x=0`. Roughly speaking,
we need only one boundary condition because of
the spatial derivative is of first order only.

*Physical interpretation.* The parameter :math:`c` can be constant or variable, :math:`c=c(x)`. The
equation :eq:`wave:app:exer:advec1D:ueq` arises in *transport*
problems where a quantity :math:`u`, which could be temperature or
concentration of some contaminant, is transported with the velocity
:math:`c` of a fluid. In addition to the transport imposed by "travelling with
the fluid", :math:`u` may also be transported by diffusion (such as
heat conduction or Fickian diffusion), but we have in
the model :math:`u_t + cu_x` assumed that diffusion effects are negligible,
which they often are.


A widely used numerical scheme for :eq:`wave:app:exer:advec1D:ueq`
applies a forward difference in time and a backward difference in
space when :math:`c>0`:


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:advec1D:u:upwind:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:advec1D:u:upwind
        
        [D_t^+ u + cD_x^-u = 0]_i^n
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

For :math:`c<0` we use a forward difference in space: :math:`[cD_x^+u]_i^n`.







We shall hereafter assume that :math:`=c(x)>0`.




To compute :eq:`wave:app:exer:advec1D:u:avar:sol` we need to integrate
:math:`1/c` to obtain :math:`C` and then compute the inverse of :math:`C`.

The inverse function computation can be easily done if we first think
discretely. Say we have some function :math:`y=g(x)` and seeks its inverse.
Plotting :math:`(x_i,y_i)`, where :math:`y_i=g(x_i)` for some mesh points :math:`x_i`,
displays :math:`g` as a function of :math:`x`.
The inverse function is simply :math:`x` as a function of :math:`g`, i.e., the
curve with points :math:`(y_i,x_i)`. We can therefore quickly compute points
at the curve of the inverse function. One way of extending these
points to a continuous function is to assume a linear variation
(known as linear interpolation)
between the points (which actually means to draw straight lines between
the points, exactly as done by a plotting program).

The function ``wrap2callable`` in ``scitools.std`` can take a set of points
and return a continuous function that corresponds to linear
variation between the points. The computation of the inverse of a
function :math:`g` on :math:`[0,L]` can then be done by


.. code-block:: python

        def inverse(g, domain, resolution=101):
            x = linspace(domain[0], domain[L], resolution)
            y = g(x)
            from scitools.std import wrap2callable
            g_inverse = wrap2callable((y, x))
            return g_inverse


To compute :math:`C(x)` we need to integrate :math:`1/c`, which can be done by
a Trapezoidal rule. Suppose we have computed :math:`C(x_i)` and need
to compute :math:`C(x_{i+1})`. Using the Trapezoidal rule with :math:`m` subintervals
over the integration domain :math:`[x_i,x_{i+1}]` gives


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:advec1D:C:recursion:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:advec1D:C:recursion
        
        C(x_{i+1}) = C(x_i) + \int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} \frac{dx}{c}
        \approx h\left(
        \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{c(x_i)} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{c(x_{i+1})}
        + \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \frac{1}{c(x_i + jh)}\right),
        
        

where :math:`h=(x_{i+1}-x_i)/m` is the length of the subintervals used
for the integral over :math:`[x_i,x_{i+1}]`.
We observe that :eq:`wave:app:exer:advec1D:C:recursion` is a
*difference equation* which we can solve by repeatedly
applying :eq:`wave:app:exer:advec1D:C:recursion` for
:math:`i=0,1,\ldots,N_x-1` if a mesh :math:`x_0,x_,\ldots,x_{N_x}` is prescribed.
Note that :math:`C(0)=0`.


*a)* Show that under the assumption of :math:`a=\hbox{const}`,


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:advec1D:uexact:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:advec1D:uexact
        
        u(x,t) = I(x - ct)
        
        

fulfills the PDE as well as the initial and boundary condition
(provided :math:`I(0)=I(L)`).

*b)* Set up a computational algorithm and implement it in a function.
Assume :math:`a` is constant and positive.

*c)* Test implementation by using the remarkable property that
the numerical solution is exact at the mesh points if
:math:`\Delta t = c^{-1}\Delta x`.

*d)* Make a movie comparing the numerical and exact solution for the
following two choices of initial conditions:


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:advec1D:I:sin:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:advec1D:I:sin
        
         I(x) = \left\lbrack\sin\left(\pi\frac{x}{L}\right)\right\rbrack^{2n}
        
        

where :math:`n` is an integer, typically :math:`n=5`,
and


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:advec1D:I:gauss:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:advec1D:I:gauss
        
        I(x) = \exp{\left( -\frac{(x-L/2)^2}{2\sigma2}\right)} {\thinspace .}
        
        

Choose :math:`\Delta t = c^{-1}\Delta x, 0.9c^{-1}\Delta x, 0.5c^{-1}\Delta x`.

*e)* The performance of the suggested numerical scheme can be investigated
by analyzing the numerical dispersion relation.
Analytically, we have that the *Fourier component*


.. math::
         u(x,t) = e^{i(kx-\omega t)},

is a solution of the PDE if :math:`\omega = kc`. This is the *analytical
dispersion relation*. A complete solution of the PDE can be built by
adding up such Fourier components with different amplitudes, where the
initial condition :math:`I` determines the amplitudes. The solution :math:`u` is
then represented by a Fourier series.

A similar discrete Fourier component at :math:`(x_p,t_n)` is


.. math::
         u_p^q = e^{i(kp\Delta x -\tilde\omega n\Delta t)},

where in general :math:`\tilde\omega` is a function of :math:`k`, :math:`\Delta t`, and
:math:`\Delta x`, and differs from the exact :math:`\omega =kc`.

Insert the discrete Fourier component in the numerical scheme and
derive an expression for :math:`\tilde\omega`, i.e.,
the discrete dispersion relation. Show in particular that if
the :math:`\Delta t/(c\Delta x)=1`, the discrete solution coincides with the
exact solution at the mesh points, regardless of the mesh resolution (!).
Show that if the stability condition


.. math::
         \frac{\Delta t}{c\Delta x}\leq 1,

the discrete Fourier component cannot grow (i.e., :math:`\tilde\omega` is real).

*f)* Write a test for your implementation where you try to use information
from the numerical dispersion relation.

*g)* Set up a computational algorithm for the variable
coefficient case and implement it in a function.
Make a test that the function works for constant :math:`a`.

*h)* It can be shown that
for an observer moving with velocity :math:`c(x)`, :math:`u` is constant.
This can be used to derive an exact solution when :math:`a` varies
with :math:`x`. Show first that


.. _Eq:wave:app:exer:advec1D:u:avar:sol:

.. math::
   :label: wave:app:exer:advec1D:u:avar:sol
        
        u(x,t) = f(C(x) - t),
        
        

where


.. math::
         C'(x) = \frac{1}{c(x)},

is a solution of :eq:`wave:app:exer:advec1D:ueq` for any
differentiable function :math:`f`.


.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

*Solution.* Let :math:`\xi = C(x) - t`.
We have that

.. math::
         u_t = f'(\xi)(-1),

while

.. math::
         u_x = f'(\xi)C'(x) = f'(\xi)\frac{1}{c(x)},

implying that :math:`au_x = f'(\xi)`. Then we have :math:`u_t + cu_x= -f'(\xi) +
f'(\xi) = 0`.

.. --- end solution of exercise ---


*i)* Use the initial condition to show that an exact solution is


.. math::
         u(x,t) = I(C^{-1}(C(x)-t)),

with :math:`C^{-1}` being the inverse function of :math:`C = \int c^{1}dx`.
Since :math:`C(x)` is an integral :math:`\int_0^x (1/c)dx`,
:math:`C(x)` is monotonically increasing and there exists hence an
inverse function :math:`C^{-1}` with values in :math:`[0,L]`.


.. --- begin solution of exercise ---

*Solution.* In general we have :math:`u(x,t) = f(C(x)-t)` and the solution is
of this form with :math:`f(\xi)=I(C^{-1}(\xi))`.
Moreover, at :math:`t=0` we have
:math:`I(C^{-1}(C(x)))=I(x)`, which is the required initial condition.

.. --- end solution of exercise ---


*j)* Implement a function for computing :math:`C(x_i)` and one for computing
:math:`C^{-1}(x)` for any :math:`x`. Use these two functions for computing
the exact solution :math:`I(C^{-1}(C(x)-t))`.
End up with a function ``u_exact_variable_c(x, n, c, I)`` that returns
the value of :math:`I(C^{-1}(C(x)-t_n))`.

*k)* Make movies showing a comparison of the numerical and exact solutions
for the two initial conditions
:eq:`wave:app:exer:advec1D:I:sin` and :eq:`wave:app:exer:advec1D:I:gauss`.
Choose :math:`\Delta t = \Delta x /\max_{0,L} c(x)`
and the velocity of the medium as

1. :math:`c(x) = 1 + \epsilon\sin(k\pi x/L)`, :math:`\epsilon <1`,

2. :math:`c(x) = 1 + I(x)`, where :math:`I` is given by
   :eq:`wave:app:exer:advec1D:I:sin` or :eq:`wave:app:exer:advec1D:I:gauss`.

The PDE :math:`u_t + cu_x=0` expresses that the initial condition :math:`I(x)`
is transported with velocity :math:`c(x)`.

.. _wave:app:exer:anal:damped:wave1D:

Problem 29: General analytical solution of a 1D damped wave equation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We consider an initial-boundary value problem for the damped wave equation:


.. math::
        
        u_{tt} +bu_t &= c^2 u_{xx}, \quad &x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0,T]\\ 
        u(0,t) &= 0,\\ 
        u(L,t) &=0,\\ 
        u(x, 0) &= I(x),\\ 
        u_t(x, 0) &= V(x){\thinspace .}
        

Here, :math:`b\geq 0` and :math:`c` are given constants. The aim is to derive a general
analytical solution of this problem. Familiarity with the method of
separation of variables for solving PDEs will be assumed.


*a)* Seek a solution on the form :math:`u(x,t)=X(x)T(t)`. Insert this solution in
the PDE and show that it leads to two differential equations for :math:`X` and :math:`T`:


.. math::
         T'' + bT' + \lambda T = 0,\quad c^2 X'' +\lambda X = 0, 

with :math:`X(0)=X(L)=0` as boundary conditions, and :math:`\lambda` as a constant
to be determined.

*b)* Show that :math:`X(x)` is on the form


.. math::
         X_n(x) = C_n\sin kx,\quad k = \frac{n\pi}{L},\quad n=1,2,\ldots

where :math:`C_n` is an arbitrary constant.

.. lambda = k**2


*c)* Under the assumption that :math:`(b/2)^2 < k^2`, show that :math:`T(t)` is on
the form


.. math::
         T_n(t) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}bt}(a_n\cos\omega t + b_n\sin\omega t),
        \quad\omega = \sqrt{k^2 - \frac{1}{4}b^2},\quad n=1,2,\ldots 

The complete solution is then


.. math::
         u(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sin kx e^{-\frac{1}{2}bt}(
        A_n\cos\omega t + B_n\sin\omega t),

where the constants :math:`A_n` and :math:`B_n` must be computed from the initial
conditions.

*d)* Derive a formula for :math:`A_n` from :math:`u(x,0)=I(x)` and developing :math:`I(x)` as a sine
Fourier series on :math:`[0,L]`.

*e)* Derive a formula for :math:`B_n` from :math:`u_t(x,0)=V(x)` and developing :math:`V(x)` as
a sine Fourier series on :math:`[0,L]`.

*f)* Calculate :math:`A_n` and :math:`B_n` from vibrations of a string where :math:`V(x)=0` and


.. _Eq:wave:pde1:guitar:I:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:guitar:I
        
        I(x) = \left\lbrace
        \begin{array}{ll}
        ax/x_0, & x < x_0,\\ 
        a(L-x)/(L-x_0), & \hbox{otherwise}
        \end{array}\right.
        
        


*g)* Implement the series for :math:`u(x,t)` in a function ``u_series(x, t, tol=1E-10)``,
where ``tol`` is a tolerance for truncating the series. Simply sum
the terms until :math:`|a_n|` and :math:`|b_b|` both are less than ``tol``.

*h)* What will change in the derivation of the analytical solution if we
have :math:`u_x(0,t)=u_x(L,t)=0` as boundary conditions?
And how will you solve the problem with :math:`u(0,t)=0` and :math:`u_x(L,t)=0`?
