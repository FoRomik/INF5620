A FEniCS Tutorial
=================

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen
:Date: Nov 13, 2013

This document presents a FEniCS tutorial to get new users quickly up
and running with solving differential equations. FEniCS can be
programmed both in C++ and Python, but this tutorial focuses
exclusively on Python programming, since this is the simplest approach
to exploring FEniCS for beginners and since it actually gives high
performance. After having digested the examples in this tutorial, the
reader should be able to learn more from the FEniCS documentation, the
numerous demos, and the comprehensive FEniCS book *Automated Solution of
Differential Equations by the Finite element Method: The FEniCS book*
[Ref01]_.

The tutorial is still in an initial state so the reader is encouraged
to send email to the author on ``hpl@simula.no`` about typos, errors,
and suggestions for improvements.


.. warning::
    This tutorial is compatible with FEniCS version 1.1.
    There are some differences between this document and
    the tutorial in the FEniCS book [Ref01]_ because of
    changes in the FEniCS software from version 1.0 to 1.1
