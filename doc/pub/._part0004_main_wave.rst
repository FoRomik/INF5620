Analysis of the difference equations

Properties of the solution of the wave equation
-----------------------------------------------

.. index::
   single: wave equation; 1D, analytical properties


The wave equation


.. math::
         \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} =
        c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
        

has solutions of the form


.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:gensol
        
        u(x,t) = g_R(x-ct) + g_L(x+ct),
        
        

for any functions :math:`g_R` and :math:`g_L` sufficiently smooth to be differentiated
twice. The result follows from inserting :eq:`wave:pde1:gensol`
in the wave equation. A function of the form :math:`g_R(x-ct)` represents a
signal
moving to the right in time with constant velocity :math:`c`.
This feature can be explained as follows.
At time :math:`t=0` the signal looks like :math:`g_R(x)`. Introducing a
moving :math:`x` axis with coordinates :math:`\xi = x-ct`, we see the function
:math:`g_R(\xi)` is "at rest"
in the :math:`\xi` coordinate system, and the shape is always
the same. Say the :math:`g_R(\xi)` function has a peak at :math:`\xi=0`. This peak
is located at :math:`x=ct`, which means that it moves with the velocity
:math:`dx/dt=c` in the :math:`x` coordinate system. Similarly, :math:`g_L(x+ct)`
is a function initially with shape :math:`g_L(x)` that moves in the negative
:math:`x` direction with constant velocity :math:`c` (introduce :math:`\xi=x+ct`,
look at the point :math:`\xi=0`, :math:`x=-ct`, which has velocity :math:`dx/dt=-c`).

With the particular initial conditions


.. math::
        
        u(x,0)=I(x),\quad \frac{\partial}{\partial t}u(x,0) =0,
        

we get, with :math:`u` as in :eq:`wave:pde1:gensol`,


.. math::
        
        g_R(x) + g_L(x) = I(x),\quad -cg_R'(x) + cg_L'(x) = 0,
        

which have the solution :math:`g_R=g_L=I/2`, and consequently


.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:gensol2
        
        u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2} I(x-ct) + \frac{1}{2} I(x+ct) \thinspace .
        
        

The interpretation of :eq:`wave:pde1:gensol2` is that
the initial shape of :math:`u` is split into two parts, each with the same
shape as :math:`I` but half
of the initial amplitude. One part is traveling to the left and the
other one to the right.

The solution has two important physical features: constant amplitude
of the left and right wave, and constant velocity of these two waves.
It turns out that the numerical solution will also preserve the
constant amplitude, but the velocity depends on the mesh parameters
:math:`\Delta t` and :math:`\Delta x`.

The solution :eq:`wave:pde1:gensol2` will be influenced by
boundary conditions when the parts
:math:`\frac{1}{2} I(x-ct)` and :math:`\frac{1}{2} I(x+ct)` hit the boundaries and get, e.g.,
reflected back into the domain. However, when :math:`I(x)` is nonzero
only in a small part in the middle
of the spatial domain :math:`[0,L]`, which means that the
boundaries are placed far away from the initial disturbance of :math:`u`,
the solution :eq:`wave:pde1:gensol2` is very clearly observed
in a simulation.

A useful representation of solutions of wave equations is a linear
combination of sine and/or cosine waves. Such a sum of waves is a
solution if the governing PDE is linear and each sine or cosine
wave fulfills the
equation.  To ease analytical calculations by hand we shall work with
complex exponential functions instead of real-valued sine or cosine
functions. The real part of complex expressions will typically be
taken as the physical relevant quantity (whenever a physical relevant
quantity is strictly needed).
The idea now is to build :math:`I(x)` of complex wave components
:math:`e^{ikx}`:

.. math::
   :label: wave:Fourier:I
         I(x) \approx \sum_{k\in K} b_k e^{ikx} \thinspace .
        
        

Here, :math:`k` is the frequency of a component,
:math:`K` is some set of all the discrete
:math:`k` values needed to approximate :math:`I(x)` well,
and :math:`b_k` are
constants that must be determined. We will very seldom
need to compute the :math:`b_k` coefficients: most of the insight
we look for and the understanding of the numerical methods we want to
establish, come from
investigating how the PDE and the scheme treat a single
component :math:`e^{ikx}` wave.

Letting the number of :math:`k` values in :math:`K` tend to infinity makes the sum
:eq:`wave:Fourier:I` converge to :math:`I(x)`, and this sum is known as a
*Fourier series* representation of :math:`I(x)`.  Looking at
:eq:`wave:pde1:gensol2`, we see that the solution :math:`u(x,t)`, when
:math:`I(x)` is represented as in :eq:`wave:Fourier:I`, is also built of
basic complex exponential wave components of the form :math:`e^{ik(x\pm
ct)}` according to


.. math::
   :label: wave:Fourier:u1
        
        u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k\in K} b_k e^{ik(x - ct)}
        + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k\in K} b_k e^{ik(x + ct)} \thinspace .
        
        

It is common to introduce the frequency in time :math:`\omega = kc` and
assume that :math:`u(x,t)` is a sum of basic wave components
written as :math:`e^{ikx -\omega t}`.
(Observe that inserting such a wave component in the governing PDE reveals that
:math:`\omega^2 = k^2c^2`, or :math:`\omega \pm kc`, reflecting the
two solutions: one (:math:`+kc`) traveling to the right and the other (:math:`-kc`)
traveling to the left.)

More precise definition of Fourier representations
--------------------------------------------------

.. index:: Fourier series


.. index:: Fourier transform


.. index:: discrete Fourier transform


The quick intuitive introduction above to representing a function by a sum
of sine and cosine waves suffices as background for the forthcoming
material on analyzing a single wave component. However, to understand
all details of how different wave components sum up to the analytical
and numerical solution, a more precise mathematical treatment is helpful
and therefore summarized below.

It is well known that periodic functions can be represented by
Fourier series. A generalization of the Fourier series idea to
non-periodic functions defined on the real line is the *Fourier transform*:



.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:Fourier:I
        
        I(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty A(k)e^{ikx}dk,
         
        



.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:Fourier:A
          
        A(k) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty I(x)e^{-ikx}dx{\thinspace .}
        
        

The function :math:`A(k)` reflects the weight of each wave component :math:`e^{ikx}`
in an infinite sum of such wave components. That is, :math:`A(k)`
reflects the frequency content in the function :math:`I(x)`. Fourier transforms
are particularly fundamental for analyzing and understanding time-varying
signals.

The solution of the linear 1D wave PDE can be expressed as


.. math::
         u(x,t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty A(k)e^{i(kx-\omega(k)t)}dx{\thinspace .}


In a finite difference method, we represent :math:`u` by a mesh function
:math:`u^n_q`, where :math:`n` counts temporal mesh points and :math:`q` counts
the spatial ones (the usual counter for spatial points, :math:`i`, is
here already used as imaginary unit). Similarly, :math:`I(x)` is approximated by
the mesh function :math:`I_q`, :math:`q=0,\ldots,N_x`.
On a mesh, it does not make sense to work with wave
components :math:`e^{ikx}` for very large :math:`k`, because the shortest possible
sine or cosine wave that can be represented on a mesh with spacing :math:`\Delta x`
is the wave with wavelength :math:`2\Delta x` (the sine/cosine signal jumps
up and down between each mesh point). The corresponding :math:`k` value is
:math:`k=2\pi /(2\Delta x) = \pi/\Delta x`, known as the *Nyquist frequency*.
Within the range of
relevant frequencies :math:`(0,\pi/\Delta x]` one defines
the `discrete Fourier transform <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform>`_, using :math:`N_x+1` discrete frequencies:


.. math::
        
        I_q = \frac{1}{N_x+1}\sum_{k=0}^{N_x} A_k e^{i2\pi k j/(N_x+1)},\quad
        i=0,\ldots,N_x,
        



.. math::
          
        A_k = \sum_{q=0}^{N_x} I_q e^{-i2\pi k q/(N_x+1)},
        \quad k=0,\ldots,N_x+1{\thinspace .}
        

The :math:`A_k` values is the discrete Fourier transform of the :math:`I_q` values,
and the latter are the inverse discrete Fourier transform of the :math:`A_k`
values.

The discrete Fourier transform is efficiently computed by the
*Fast Fourier transform* algorithm. For a real function :math:`I(x)`
the relevant Python code for computing and plotting
the discrete Fourier transform appears in the example below.


.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        from numpy import sin
        
        def I(x):
            return sin(2*pi*x) + 0.5*sin(4*pi*x) + 0.1*sin(6*pi*x)
        
        # Mesh
        L = 10; Nx = 100
        x = np.linspace(0, L, Nx+1)
        dx = L/float(Nx)
        
        # Discrete Fourier transform
        A = np.fft.rfft(I(x))
        A_amplitude = np.abs(A)
        
        # Compute the corresponding frequencies
        freqs = np.linspace(0, pi/dx, A_amplitude.size)
        
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        plt.plot(freqs, A_amplitude)

The scheme


.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:analysis:scheme
        
        [D_tD_t u = c^2 D_xD_x u]^n_q
        
        

for the wave equation :math:`u_t = c^2u_{xx}` allows basic wave components


.. math::
         u^n_q=e^{i(kx_q - \tilde\omega t_n)} 

as solution, but it turns out that
the frequency in time, :math:`\tilde\omega`, is not equal to
the exact :math:`\omega = kc`.  The idea now is to study how the scheme treats
an arbitrary wave component with a given :math:`k`. We ask two key
questions:

 * How accurate is :math:`\tilde\omega`
   compared to :math:`\omega`?

 * Does the amplitude of such a wave component
   preserve its (unit) amplitude, as it should,
   or does it get amplified or damped in time (due to a complex :math:`\tilde\omega`)?

The following analysis will answer these questions.
Note the need for using :math:`q` as counter for the mesh point in :math:`x` direction
since :math:`i` is already used as the imaginary unit (in this analysis).

.. We use :math:`p` because we can then naturally continue with :math:`q` and :math:`r` as indices

.. in the :math:`y` and :math:`z` directions.


Preliminary results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A key result needed in the investigations is the finite difference
approximation of a second-order derivative acting on a complex
wave component:


.. math::
        
        [D_tD_t e^{i\omega t}]^n = -\frac{4}{\Delta t^2}\sin^2\left(
        \frac{\omega\Delta t}{2}\right)e^{i\omega n\Delta t}
        \thinspace .
        

By just changing symbols (:math:`\omega\rightarrow k`,
:math:`t\rightarrow x`, :math:`n\rightarrow q`) it follows that


.. math::
        
        [D_xD_x e^{ikx}]_q = -\frac{4}{\Delta x^2}\sin^2\left(
        \frac{k\Delta x}{2}\right)e^{ikq\Delta x} \thinspace .
        


Numerical wave propagation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inserting a basic wave component :math:`u^n_q=e^{i(kx_q-\tilde\omega t_n)}` in
:eq:`wave:pde1:analysis:scheme` results in the need to
evaluate two expressions:


.. math::
        
        \lbrack D_tD_t e^{ikx}e^{-i\tilde\omega t}\rbrack^n_q = \lbrack D_tD_t e^{-i\tilde\omega t}\rbrack^ne^{ikq\Delta x}\nonumber
        



.. math::
          = -\frac{4}{\Delta t^2}\sin^2\left(
        \frac{\tilde\omega\Delta t}{2}\right)e^{-i\tilde\omega n\Delta t}e^{ikq\Delta x}
        



.. math::
          
        \lbrack D_xD_x e^{ikx}e^{-i\tilde\omega t}\rbrack^n_q = \lbrack D_xD_x e^{ikx}\rbrack_q e^{-i\tilde\omega n\Delta t}\nonumber
        



.. math::
          = -\frac{4}{\Delta x^2}\sin^2\left(
        \frac{k\Delta x}{2}\right)e^{ikq\Delta x}e^{-i\tilde\omega n\Delta t} \thinspace . 

Then the complete scheme,


.. math::
        
        \lbrack D_tD_t e^{ikx}e^{-i\tilde\omega t} = c^2D_xD_x e^{ikx}e^{-i\tilde\omega t}\rbrack^n_q
        

leads to the following equation for the unknown numerical
frequency :math:`\tilde\omega`
(after dividing by :math:`-e^{ikx}e^{-i\tilde\omega t}`):


.. math::
        
        \frac{4}{\Delta t^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{\tilde\omega\Delta t}{2}\right)
        = c^2 \frac{4}{\Delta x^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{k\Delta x}{2}\right),
        

or


.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:analysis:sineq1
        
        \sin^2\left(\frac{\tilde\omega\Delta t}{2}\right)
        = C^2\sin^2\left(\frac{k\Delta x}{2}\right),
        
        

where


.. index:: Courant number



.. math::
        
        C = \frac{c\Delta t}{\Delta x}
        

is the Courant number.
Taking the square root of :eq:`wave:pde1:analysis:sineq1` yields


.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:analysis:sineq2
        
        \sin\left(\frac{\tilde\omega\Delta t}{2}\right)
        = C\sin\left(\frac{k\Delta x}{2}\right),
        
        

Since the exact :math:`\omega` is real it is reasonable to look for a real
solution :math:`\tilde\omega` of :eq:`wave:pde1:analysis:sineq2`.
The right-hand side of
:eq:`wave:pde1:analysis:sineq2` must then be in :math:`[-1,1]` because
the sine function on the left-hand side has values in :math:`[-1,1]`
for real :math:`\tilde\omega`. The sine function on
the right-hand side can attain the value 1 when


.. math::
        
        \frac{k\Delta x}{2} = m\frac{\pi}{2},\quad m\in\mathbb{Z}
        \thinspace .
        

With :math:`m=1` we have :math:`k\Delta x = \pi`, which means that
the wavelength :math:`\lambda = 2\pi/k` becomes :math:`2\Delta x`. This is
the absolutely shortest wavelength that can be represented on the mesh:
the wave jumps up and down between each mesh point. Larger values of :math:`|m|`
are irrelevant since these correspond to :math:`k` values whose
waves are too short to be represented
on a mesh with spacing :math:`\Delta x`.
For the shortest possible wave in the mesh, :math:`\sin\left(k\Delta x/2\right)=1`,
and we must require


.. index:: stability criterion


.. index::
   single: wave equation; 1D, stability



.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:stability:crit
        
        C\leq 1 \thinspace .
        
        


Consider a right-hand side in :eq:`wave:pde1:analysis:sineq2` of
magnitude larger
than unity. The solution :math:`\tilde\omega` of :eq:`wave:pde1:analysis:sineq2`
.. see the chapter :ref:`sec:ode:o:eq1:analysis`

must then be a complex number
:math:`\tilde\omega = \tilde\omega_r + i\tilde\omega_i` because
the sine function is larger than unity for a complex argument.
One can show that for any :math:`\omega_i`  there will also be a
corresponding solution with :math:`-\omega_i`. The component with :math:`\omega_i>0`
gives an amplification factor :math:`e^{\omega_it}` that grows exponentially
in time. We cannot allow this and must therefore require :math:`C\leq 1`
as a *stability criterion*.



.. admonition:: Remark

   For smoother wave components with longer wave lengths per length :math:`\Delta x`,
   :eq:`wave:pde1:stability:crit` can in theory be relaxed. However,
   small round-off errors are always present in a numerical solution and these
   vary arbitrarily from mesh point to mesh point and can be viewed as
   unavoidable noise with wavelength :math:`2\Delta x`. As explained, :math:`C>1`
   will for this very small noise lead to exponential growth of
   the shortest possible wave component in the mesh. This noise will
   therefore grow with time and destroy the whole solution.


.. _wave:pde1:num:dispersion:

Numerical dispersion relation
-----------------------------

Equation :eq:`wave:pde1:analysis:sineq2` can be solved with respect
to :math:`\tilde\omega`:


.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:disprel
        
        \tilde\omega = \frac{2}{\Delta t}
        \sin^{-1}\left( C\sin\left(\frac{k\Delta x}{2}\right)\right) \thinspace .
        
        

The relation between the numerical frequency :math:`\tilde\omega` and
the other parameters :math:`k`, :math:`c`, :math:`\Delta x`, and :math:`\Delta t` is called
a *numerical dispersion relation*. Correspondingly,
:math:`\omega =kc` is the *analytical dispersion relation*.

The special case :math:`C=1` deserves attention since then the right-hand side
of :eq:`wave:pde1:disprel` reduces to


.. math::
         \frac{2}{\Delta t}\frac{k\Delta x}{2} = \frac{1}{\Delta t}
        \frac{\omega\Delta x}{c} = \frac{\omega}{C} = \omega \thinspace . 

That is, :math:`\tilde\omega = \omega` and the numerical solution is exact
at all mesh points regardless of :math:`\Delta x` and :math:`\Delta t`!
This implies that the numerical solution method is also an analytical
solution method, at least for computing :math:`u` at discrete points (the
numerical method says nothing about the
variation of :math:`u` *between* the mesh points, and employing the
common linear interpolation for extending the discrete solution
gives a curve that deviates from the exact one).

For a closer examination of the error in the numerical dispersion
relation when :math:`C<1`, we can study
:math:`\tilde\omega -\omega`, :math:`\tilde\omega/\omega`, or the similar
error measures in wave velocity: :math:`\tilde c - c` and :math:`\tilde c/c`,
where :math:`c=\omega /k` and :math:`\tilde c = \tilde\omega /k`.
It appears that the most convenient expression to work with is :math:`\tilde c/c`:


.. math::
        
        \frac{\tilde c}{c} = \frac{1}{Cp}{\sin}^{-1}\left(C\sin p\right),
        

with :math:`p=k\Delta x/2` as a non-dimensional measure of the spatial frequency.
In essence, :math:`p` tells how many spatial mesh points we have per
wave length in space of the wave component with frequency :math:`k` (the wave
length is :math:`2\pi/k`). That is, :math:`p` reflects how well the
spatial variation of the wave component
is resolved in the mesh. Wave components with wave length
less than :math:`2\Delta x` (:math:`2\pi/k < 2\Delta x`) are not visible in the mesh,
so it does not make sense to have :math:`p>\pi/2`.

We may introduce the function :math:`r(C, p)=\tilde c/c` for further investigation
of numerical errors in the wave velocity:


.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:disprel2
        
        r(C, p) = \frac{1}{Cp}{\sin}^{-1}\left(C\sin p\right), \quad C\in (0,1],\ p\in (0,\pi/2] \thinspace .
        
        

This function is very well suited for plotting since it combines several
parameters in the problem into a dependence on two non-dimensional
numbers, :math:`C` and :math:`p`.


.. _wave:pde1:fig:disprel:

   *The fractional error in the wave velocity for different Courant numbers*


Defining


.. code-block:: python

        def r(C, p):
            return 2/(C*p)*asin(C*sin(p))

we can plot :math:`r(C,p)` as a function of :math:`p` for various values of
:math:`C`, see Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:fig:disprel`. Note that the shortest
waves have the most erroneous velocity, and that short waves move
more slowly than they should.

With ``sympy`` we can also easily make a Taylor series expansion in the
discretization parameter :math:`p`:


.. code-block:: text


        >>> C, p = symbols('C p')
        >>> rs = r(C, p).series(p, 0, 7)
        >>> print rs
        1 - p**2/6 + p**4/120 - p**6/5040 + C**2*p**2/6 -
        C**2*p**4/12 + 13*C**2*p**6/720 + 3*C**4*p**4/40 -
        C**4*p**6/16 + 5*C**6*p**6/112 + O(p**7)
        >>> # Factorize each term and drop the remainder O(...) term
        >>> rs_factored = [factor(term) for term in rs.lseries(p)]
        >>> rs_factored = sum(rs_factored)
        >>> print rs_factored
        p**6*(C - 1)*(C + 1)*(225*C**4 - 90*C**2 + 1)/5040 +
        p**4*(C - 1)*(C + 1)*(3*C - 1)*(3*C + 1)/120 +
        p**2*(C - 1)*(C + 1)/6 + 1

We see that :math:`C=1` makes all the terms in ``rs_factored`` vanish, except
the last one.
Since we already know that the numerical solution is exact for :math:`C=1`, the
remaining terms in the Taylor series expansion
will also contain factors of :math:`C-1` and cancel for :math:`C=1`.

From the ``rs_factored`` expression above we also see that the leading
order terms in the error of this series expansion are


.. math::
        
        \frac{1}{6}\left(\frac{k\Delta x}{2}\right)^2(C^2-1)
        = \frac{k^2}{24}\left( c^2\Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2\right),
        

pointing to an error :math:`{\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2, \Delta x^2)}`, which is
compatible with the errors in the difference approximations (:math:`D_tD_t`
and :math:`D_xD_x`).

The typical analytical solution of a 2D wave equation


.. math::
         u_{tt} = c^2(u_{xx} + u_{yy}), 

is a wave traveling in the direction of :math:`\boldsymbol{k} = k_x\boldsymbol{i} + k_y\boldsymbol{j}`, where
:math:`\boldsymbol{i}` and :math:`\boldsymbol{j}` are unit vectors in the :math:`x` and :math:`y` directions, respectively.
Such a wave can be expressed by


.. math::
         u(x,y,t) = g(k_xx + k_yy - kct) 

for some twice differentiable function :math:`g`, or with :math:`\omega =kc`, :math:`k=|\boldsymbol{k}|`:


.. math::
         u(x,y,t) = g(k_xx + k_yy - \omega t){\thinspace .} 

We can in particular build a solution by adding complex Fourier components
of the form


.. math::
        
        \exp{(i(k_xx + k_yy - \omega t))}
        \thinspace .
        


A discrete 2D wave equation can be written as

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:analysis:scheme2D
        
        \lbrack D_tD_t u = c^2(D_xD_x u + D_yD_y u)\rbrack^n_{q,r}
        \thinspace .
        
        

This equation admits a Fourier component

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:analysis:numsol2D
        
        u^n_{q,r} = \exp{\left( i(k_x q\Delta x + k_y r\Delta y
        - \tilde\omega n\Delta t)\right)},
        
        

as solution. Letting the operators :math:`D_tD_t`, :math:`D_xD_x`, and :math:`D_yD_y`
act on :math:`u^n_{q,r}` from :eq:`wave:pde1:analysis:numsol2D` transforms
:eq:`wave:pde1:analysis:scheme2D` to

.. math::
        
        \frac{4}{\Delta t^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{\tilde\omega\Delta t}{2}\right)
        = c^2 \frac{4}{\Delta x^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{k_x\Delta x}{2}\right)
        + c^2 \frac{4}{\Delta y^2}\sin^2\left(\frac{k_y\Delta y}{2}\right) \thinspace . 

or

.. math::
        
        \sin^2\left(\frac{\tilde\omega\Delta t}{2}\right)
        = C_x^2\sin^2 p_x
        + C_y^2\sin^2 p_y, 

where we have eliminated the factor 4 and introduced the symbols


.. math::
         C_x = \frac{c^2\Delta t^2}{\Delta x^2},\quad
        C_y = \frac{c^2\Delta t^2}{\Delta y^2}, \quad
        p_x = \frac{k_x\Delta x}{2},\quad
        p_y = \frac{k_y\Delta y}{2}{\thinspace .}
        

For a real-valued :math:`\tilde\omega` the right-hand side
must be less than or equal to unity in absolute value, requiring in general
that


.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:analysis:2DstabC
        
        C_x^2 + C_y^2 \leq 1 \thinspace .
        
        

This gives the stability criterion, more commonly expressed directly
in an inequality for the time step:


.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:analysis:2Dstab
        
        \Delta t \leq \frac{1}{c} \left( \frac{1}{\Delta x^2} +
        \frac{1}{\Delta y^2}\right)^{-{1/2}}
        
        

A similar, straightforward analysis for the 3D case leads to


.. math::
        
        \Delta t \leq \frac{1}{c}\left( \frac{1}{\Delta x^2} +
        \frac{1}{\Delta y^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta z^2}\right)^{-{1/2}}
        

In the case of a variable coefficient :math:`c^2=c^2(\boldsymbol{x})`, we must use
the worst-case value


.. math::
        
        \bar c = \sqrt{\max_{\boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega} c^2(\boldsymbol{x})}
        

in the stability criteria. Often, especially in the variable wave
velocity case, it is wise to introduce a safety factor :math:`\beta\in (0,1]` too:


.. math::
        
        \Delta t \leq \beta \frac{1}{\bar c}
        \left( \frac{1}{\Delta x^2} +
        \frac{1}{\Delta y^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta z^2}\right)^{-{1/2}}
        



The exact numerical dispersion relations in 2D and 3D becomes, for constant :math:`c`,


.. math::
        
        \tilde\omega = \frac{2}{\Delta t}\sin^{-1}\left(
        \left( C_x^2\sin^2 p_x + C_y^2\sin^ p_y\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right),
        



.. math::
          
        \tilde\omega = \frac{2}{\Delta t}\sin^{-1}\left(
        \left( C_x^2\sin^2 p_x + C_y^2\sin^ p_y + C_z^2\sin^ p_z\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right){\thinspace .}
        


We can visualize the numerical dispersion error in 2D much like we did
in 1D. To this end, we need to reduce the number of parameters in
:math:`\tilde\omega`. The direction of the wave is parameterized by the
polar angle :math:`\theta`, which means that


.. math::
         k_x = k\sin\theta,\quad k_y=k\cos\theta{\thinspace .}

A simplification is to set :math:`\Delta x=\Delta y=h`.
Then :math:`C_x=C_y=c\Delta t/h`, which we call :math:`C`. Also,


.. math::
         p_x=\frac{1}{2} kh\cos\theta,\quad p_y=\frac{1}{2} kh\sin\theta{\thinspace .}

The numerical frequency :math:`\tilde\omega`
is now a function of three parameters:

  * :math:`C` reflecting the number cells a wave is displaced during a time step

  * :math:`kh` reflecting the number of cells per wave length in space

  * :math:`\theta` expressing the direction of the wave

We want to visualize the error in the numerical frequency. To avoid having
:math:`\Delta t` as a free parameter in :math:`\tilde\omega`, we work with
:math:`\tilde c/c`, because the fraction :math:`2/\Delta t` is then rewritten as


.. math::
         \frac{2}{kc\Delta t} = \frac{2}{2kc\Delta t h/h} =
        \frac{1}{Ckh},

and


.. math::
         \frac{\tilde c}{c} = \frac{1}{Ckh}
        \sin^{-1}\left(C\left(\sin^2 (\frac{1}{2}kh\cos\theta)
        + \sin^2(\frac{1}{2}kh\sin\theta) \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\right){\thinspace .}
        

We want to visualize this quantity as a function of
:math:`kh` and :math:`\theta` for some values of :math:`C\leq 1`. It is
instructive
to make color contour plots of :math:`1-\tilde c/c` in
*polar coordinates* with :math:`\theta` as the angular coordinate and
:math:`kh` as the radial coordinate.

The stability criterion :eq:`wave:pde1:analysis:2DstabC`
becomes :math:`C\leq C_{\max} = 1/\sqrt{2}` in the present 2D case with the
:math:`C` defined above. Let us plot :math:`1-\tilde c/c` in polar coordinates
for :math:`C_{\max}, 0.9C_{\max}, 0.5C_{\max}, 0.2C_{\max}`.
The program below does the somewhat tricky
work in Matplotlib, and the result appears
in Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:fig:disprel2D`. From the figure we clearly
see that the maximum :math:`C` value gives the best results, and that
waves whose propagation direction makes an angle of 45 degrees with
an axis are the most accurate.
