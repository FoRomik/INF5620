#TITLE: INF5620 Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations

# #ifdef EXAM
===== Exam =====

Out of 18 candidates who took the exam, 7 got A, 6 got B, 2 got C, and
all three PhD students passed. The exceptional result of A and B for
16 out of 18 is first of all due to extensive and very successful
preparations - and perhaps a small component of luck in that 11 of the
A and B candidates presented Problem 2 or 3 (!).  The die was not
completely fair in the 18 trials as we had Problem 4 twice, Problem 1
once, Problem 5 once, and Problem 6 three times.
