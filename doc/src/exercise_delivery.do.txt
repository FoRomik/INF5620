======= How to submit an exercise or project =======

Exercises or projects are not accepted as email attachments (too
inefficient procedure with storing and archiving files). Instead,
all files associated with exercises or projects must exist in some
directory in some project managed by a version control system.
This is the way people collaborate in 2012.

 * Get an account on a project hosting site (GitHub, Bitbucket,
   Googlecode, or similar). This can be a personal account or
   a group account.
 * Make a project for INF5620, essentially consisting of a directory
   tree of all the files you create for the course.
 * Send the clone command to hpl@simula.no and make sure
   hplgit on GitHub, hplbit on Bitbucket, or hpl@simula.no on
   Googlecode has push (write) access in the project.
 * Organize exercises and projects in a clean directory structure.
   Send the name of the project directory containing a specific exercise/project
   in email to hpl@simula.no. (A simple pull command will then retrieve
   all the new files and a file `FEEDBACK.txt` with comments on the work
   can be added and communicated back.)

A simple need-to-know intro to project hosting sites and version
control systems has been written ("HTML": "http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/bitgit/html/index.html", "PDF": "http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/bitgit/Langtangen_bitgit.pdf"). Here are some recommendations on what to choose:

 * Some students may want to keep their course work private and open only
   to collaborators and the lecturer:
   * Bitbucket allows you to have private repositories for free, with
     up to five collaborators.
   * All projects on GitHub are by default public, but one can pay for
     private repos. Students can request private repos for free,
     see URL: "https://github.com/edu".
     All projects on Googlecode also have to be public.
 * Some claim that the learning curve of Git is steeper than that
   of Mercurial. This is probably due to the nature of Git tutorials
   and manuals and less rooted in technical differences between the
   two systems.
 * The combination of private repos on Bitbucket and Git as version
   control system might be a good choice for many.
