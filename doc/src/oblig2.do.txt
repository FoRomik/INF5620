# #if FORMAT == "html"
"PDF version": "oblig2.pdf"
# #endif

 * Deadline: Oct 15
 * We recommend to work in groups of two (or three if the amount of work
   is suitably extended). It is possible to work alone too.
 * Make a directory `oblig2` in the top directory of your INF5620
   repo on GitHub or
   Bitbucket to hold the various files of the project. Include a `README`
   file with a short overview of the different files and the full names
   of the students who did the project.
 * Make reusable, flexible code.
 * Write a short report summarizing the main results. LaTeX is
   probably the preferred format, but there are several
   "other options": "http://hplgit.github.io/teamods/writing_reports/index.html" too.
 * Note that the last part of this compulsory exericse allows different
   groups to go in different directions (visualization, high-performance
   computing, more advanced numerics).

======= Mathematical problem =======

The project addresses the two-dimensional, standard, linear wave equation,
with damping,
!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} + b\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q (x,y)
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right) +
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( q (x,y)
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) + f(x,y,t),
\end{equation}
!et
with boundary condition
!bt
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = 0,
\end{equation}
!et
in a rectangular spatial domain $\Omega = [0,L_x]\times [0,L_y]$.
The initial conditions are

!bt
\begin{align}
u(x,y,0)&=I(x,y),\\
u_t(x,y,0)&=V(x,y).
\end{align}
!et


======= Discretization =======

Derive the discrete set of equations to be implemented in a program:

  * the general scheme for computing $u_{i,j}^{n+1}$ at interior
    spatial mesh points,
  * the modified scheme for the first step,
  * the modified scheme at boundary points (first step and subsequent
    steps), unless you use the interior
    scheme also at the boundary with extra ghost cells.

======= Truncation error =======

Compute the truncation error of the scheme at an arbitrary interior mesh point.
(It easier to start with $q=\hbox{const}$ and then generalize to variable $q$).

======= Implementation =======

Implement the numerical scheme in a program. You may use
"`wave2D_u0.py`":
"https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/wave/wave2D_u0/wave2D_u0.py"
as a starting point (this program solves the 2D wave equation
with constant wave velocity and $u=0$ on the boundary).
You will need to include both scalar (pointwise)
computation of the scheme for debugging and reference as well as a
vectorized version for speed.

======= Verification: constant solution =======

Construct a test case with constant solution (not 0 or 1).
Make a corresponding nose test.

Invent five types of possible bugs in the implementation of the mathematical
formulas. See how many of them that lead to a wrong non-constant solution.

======= Verification: cubic solution =======

Assume an exact solution on the form $\uex(x,y,t)=X(x)Y(y)T(t)$ where
$X$, $Y$, and $T$ are polynomials of degree three or less.
Construct $X$ and $Y$ such that the normal derivative vanishes at the
four boundaries. Fit a corresponding source term $f(x,y,t)$ in the wave
equation.

It would be great if this exact solution also were an exact solution
of the discrete equations when $q$ is constant and $b=0$,
which is often the case with lower-order
polynomials because the truncation errors involve higher-order derivatives.
The exact cubic solution fits the discrete equations at all inner
mesh points, but not on the boundary. Add a term in the boundary
equation for testing such that the exact solution also fulfills the
boundary equation. Implement a corresponding nose test.


__Hint.__ We outline some ideas in 1D.
For constant $q$ and $b=0$ we have the scheme
$[D_tD_t u - qD_xD_x = f]^n_{i}$ at inner points.
Because $[D_xD_x x^3]_i = 6x_i$,
$[D_xD_x x^2]_i = 2$, $[D_xD_x x]_i = 0$ all are exact, the suggested
$u$ also fits the discrete equation. On the boundary we get a modified
scheme, which in operator notation can be written as

!bt
\[ [D_tD_t u= qD_xD_x u + q\frac{2}{\Delta x}D_{2x} u + f]^n_i,\quad i=0,\]
!et
and

!bt
\[ [D_tD_t u= qD_xD_x - q\frac{2}{\Delta x}D_{2x} u + f]^n_i,\quad i=N_x\ts\]
!et
We have the results
$[D_{2x} x^3]_i =  3x_i^2 + \Delta x^2$,
and $[D_{2x} x^2]_i = 2x_i$, $[D_{2x} x]_i=1$.
Consider now
$[D_tD_t u= qD_xD_x u - q\frac{2}{\Delta x}D_{2x}u + f]^n_i$.
Inserting $u=X(x)T(t)$ requires the same $f$ as for the PDE, but with
an additional term $T(t)2q\Delta x$ because of the $D_{2x}$ operator acting
on a cubic polynomial in $x$.

This test requires the $f$ that fits the PDE to be modified on the
boundary. A possible implementation is to modify the array of
$f$ values at the boundary mesh points directly, or perform
tests on the coordinates if a pointwise
evaluation of $f$ is requested:

!bc pycod
def f(x, y, t):
    if isinstance(x, np.ndarray) and isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
        # Array evaluation
        f_a = .... # evaluate the f that fits the PDE
        # Modify boundary values
        f_a[0,:]  = ... # x=0
        f_a[-1,:] = ... # x=Lx
        f_a[:,0]  = ... # y=0
        f_a[:,-1] = ... # x=Ly
    else:
        # Assume pointwise evaluation
        tol = 1E-14  # tolerance for float comparison
        f_v = ... # evaluate the f that fits the PDE
        # Modify boundary values
        if abs(x) < tol:
            f_v = ...   # x=0
        if abs(x-Lx) < tol:
            f_v = ...   # x=Lx
        if abs(y) < tol:
            f_v = ...   # y=0
        if abs(y-Ly) < tol:
            f_v = ...   # y=Ly
!ec


======= Exact 1D plug-wave solution in 2D =======

The program "`wave1D_dn_vc.py`":
"https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/wave/wave1D/wave1D_dn_vc.py" has a `pulse` function for simulating the propagation of a plug wave,
where $I(x)$ is constant in some region of the domain and zero elsewhere.
With unit Courant number, the plug is split into two identical waves,
moving in opposite direction, exactly one cell per time
step. The discrete solution is then equal to the exact solution.

Set $b=0$ and $q$ to a constant.
Test the 2D program using a one-dimensional plug wave in $x$ direction with
$c\Delta t/\Delta x=1$ (the plug is constant in $y$ direction and hence
compatible with the $\partial/\partial y=0$ boundary condition).
Also propagate a one-dimensional plug wave in the $y$
direction with $c\Delta t/\Delta y=1$. Both test cases are essentially
1D test cases, and the results should as in the 1D case.
Implement a corresponding nose test.

======= Verification: standing, undamped waves =======

With no damping and constant wave velocity,
our wave equation problem without any source
term admits
a standing wave solution:

!bt
\begin{equation}
\uex(x,y,t)=A\cos(k_xx)\cos(k_yy)\cos (\omega t),\quad
k_x = \frac{m_x\pi}{L_x}, \ k_y = \frac{m_y\pi}{L_y},
label{wave:app:exer:standing:waves}
\end{equation}
!et
for arbitrary amplitude $A$, arbitrary integers $m_x$ and $m_y$,
and a suitable choice of $\omega$. This solution can be used to test
the convergence rate of the numerical method.

Use the
truncation error analysis to
set up a model for the error in terms of the discretization parameters.
Note that the truncation error is not the true error
$e^n_{i,j}=\uex(x_i,y_j,t_n) - u^n_{i,j}$, but we assume
that $e^n_{i,j}$ depends on the discretization parameters in the same way.
We also assume that a norm of $e^n_{i,j}$, e.g.,

!bt
\[ E = ||e^n_{i,j}||_{\ell^\infty} = \max_{i}\max_{j}\max_{t}
|e^n_{i,j}|,\]
!et
also depends on the discretization parameters in the same way.
Introduce a common discretization parameter $h$ such that
$\Delta t$, $\Delta x$, and $\Delta y$ are proportional to $h$.
Show that $E=Ch^2$ for some $C$ is the expected behavior of the error.
Perform experiments with decreasing $h$, compute $E$, and verify that
$E/h^2$ is approximately constant.

======= Verification: standing, damped waves =======

Try to find an analytical solution of damped waves using an ansatz
of the type

!bt
\begin{equation}
\uex(x,y,t)=\left(A\cos (\omega t)
+ B\sin (\omega t)\right)
e^{-bt}\cos(k_xx)\cos(k_yym_yy\pi/L_y),\quad
k_x = \frac{m_x\pi}{L_x}, \ k_y = \frac{m_y\pi}{L_y}\ts
label{wave:app:exer:standing:waves:damped}
\end{equation}
!et
That is, find $A$, $B$, and $\omega$ such that
(ref{wave:app:exer:standing:waves:damped}) solves the PDE with
constant $q$, no
source term, and initial condition $u_t(x,y,0)=0$ (as for the
undamped standing waves). Make a corresponding convergence test.

__Hint.__ The algebra can quickly be quite involved. Getting an
overview of the algebra in a 1D version of this problem might be
helpful.  Start with relating $A$ and $B$ through the initial
conditions ($u=A\cos k_xx\cos k_yy$ and $u_t=0$ as implied by
(ref{wave:app:exer:standing:waves})) and eliminate $B$.  After having
inserted $u$ in the PDE, two equations for $\omega$ and $c$ arise from
factoring the sine and cosine terms in time. One equation can be
solved for $\omega = \sqrt{k_x^2q + k_y^2q - c^2}$, while the other
can be solved for $c=b/2$ by inserting the found $\omega$ expression.


======= Verification: manufactured solution =======

Choose some $q(x,y)\neq 0$ and find $f(x,y,t)$ such that
({wave:app:exer:standing:waves:damped}) is a solution to the general
2D wave equation problem with damping and variable wave velocity.
Find corresponding $I$ and $V$, and make a convergence test that
recovers the expected convergence rate. Make a corresponding nose test.

__Hint.__ You may explore `sympy` for automating the analytical work:

!bc ipy
>>> from sympy import *
>>> x = Symbol('x')
>>> q=x**2
>>> u=sin(x)
>>> r = diff(q*diff(u, x), x)   # Derivative: (q*u_x)_x
>>> simplify(r)
x*(-x*sin(x) + 2*cos(x))
!ec

======= Investigate a physical problem =======

The purpose of this part is to explore what happens to a wave that
enters a medium with different wave velocity. A particular physical
interpretation can be wave propagation of a tsunami over a subsea
hill. The unknown $u(x,y,t)$ is then the elevation of the ocean
surface, and the boundary condition $\partial u/\partial n=0$ means
that the waves are perfectly reflected, because of a steep hill at the
shore, or the condition expresses symmetry in the solution.  The wave
velocity is in this case
given by $q = gH(x,y)$, where $g$ is the acceleration of
gravity and $H(x,y)$ is the stillwater depth.

It can be wise to do "Problem 21": "../pub/sphinx_wave/._part0010_main_wave.html#problem-21-earthquake-generated-tsunami-over-a-subsea-hill", because a 1D program corresponding to the present
2D problem allows much faster experimentation with parameters and
effects.

The initial surface is taken as a smooth Gaussian function

!bt
\begin{equation}
I(x;I_0,I_a,I_m,I_s) =
I_0 + I_a\exp{\left(-\left(\frac{x-I_m}{I_s}\right)^2\right)},
\end{equation}
!et
with $I_m=0$ reflecting the location of the peak of $I(x)$ and
$I_s$ being a measure of the width of the function $I(x)$
($I_s$ is $\sqrt{2}$ times the standard deviation of the familiar
normal distribution curve).

Three different bottom shapes can be investigated.
A 2D Gaussian hill can be modeled by

!bt
\begin{equation}
B(x;B_0,B_a,B_{mx}, B_{my} ,B_s, b) =
B_0 + B_a\exp{\left(-\left(\frac{x-B_{mx}}{B_s}\right)^2
-\left(\frac{y-B_{my}}{bB_s}\right)^2\right)},
label{wave:app:exer:tsunami2D:hill:Gauss}
\end{equation}
!et
where $b$ is a scaling parameter: $b=1$ gives a circular Gaussian
function with circular contour lines, while $b\neq 1$ gives an elliptic
shape with elliptic contour lines.

A less smooth hill is modeled by the "cosine hat" function

!bt
\begin{equation}
B(x; B_0, B_a, B_{mx}, B_{my}, B_s) =
B_0 + B_a\cos{\left( \pi\frac{x-B_{mx}}{2B_s}\right)}
\cos{\left( \pi\frac{y-B_{my}}{2B_s}\right)},
label{wave:app:exer:tsunami2D:hill:cohat}
\end{equation}
!et
when $0 \leq \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \leq B_s$ and $B=B_0$ outside this circle.

A more dramatic hill shape is a box:

!bt
\begin{equation}
B(x; B_0, B_a, B_m, B_s, b) = B_0 + B_a
label{wave:app:exer:tsunami2D:hill:box}
\end{equation}
!et
for $x$ and $y$ inside a rectangle
!bt
\[ B_{mx}-B_s \leq  x \leq B_{mx} + B_s,\quad
B_{my}-bB_s \leq  y \leq B_{my} + bB_s,
\]
!et
and $B=B_0$ outside this rectangle.
The $b$ parameter controls the rectangular shape of the cross section of
the box.

Note that the initial condition and the listed bottom shapes are
symmetric around the line $y=B_{my}$. We therefore expect the surface
elevation also to be symmetric with respect to this line.  This means
that we can halve the computational domain by working with
$[0,L_x]\times [0, B_{my}]$. Along the upper boundary, $y=B_{my}$, we
must impose the symmetry condition $\partial \eta/\partial n=0$.  Such
a symmetry condition ($-\eta_x=0$) is also needed at the $x=0$
boundary because the initial condition has a symmetry here. At the
lower boundary $y=0$ we also set a Neumann condition (which becomes
$-\eta_y=0$).  The wave motion is to be simulated until the wave hits
the reflecting boundaries where $\partial\eta/\partial n =\eta_x =0$.

Investigate how different hill shapes, different sizes of the water
gap above the hill, and different resolutions $\Delta x = \Delta y =
h$ and $\Delta t$ influence the numerical quality of the solution. One
anticipates that the less smooth hill shapes will introduce more
numerical noise.  Presenting the results as movies of the surface
elevation is effective.

======= Additional tasks =======

The groups can select between one or more of the following tasks.

===== Harmonic averaging =====

Harmonic means are often used if the coefficient $q$ is
non-smooth or discontinuous. Investigate if harmonic averaging of $q$
works better than the arithmetic averging for the box-shaped subsea hill.
The effect might not be big unless the water gap at the top of the
hill is small. It can be wise to test the effect of harmonic averaging in
1D first.

__Remark.__ With a small gap between the obstruction and the free surface,
and with abrupt changes in the bottom shape, the model PDE does not
necessarily describe the wave motion in an accurate or qualitatively correct
way.


===== Visualization =====

Create some fancy 3D visualization of the water waves *and* the subsea hill.
Try to make the hill transparent. Suitable tools are

  * "Mayavi": "http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/"
  * "Paraview": "http://www.paraview.org/"
  * "OpenDX": "http://www.opendx.org/"
  * "Matplotlib": "http://matplotlib.org/"

===== Open outlet boundary: 1D condition =====

Implement an open boundary condition at $x=L_x$, $u_t + \sqrt{q}u_x=0$,
as suggested
in "Problem 20": "../pub/sphinx_wave/._part0010_main_wave.html#problem-20-implement-open-boundary-conditions".
This condition is only correct in 1D, but might work satisfactorily in 2D if
the wave is approximately one-dimensional when it hits the boundary.
See how well this condition works in letting the tsunami pass out of
the domain. The distance from the subsea hill (which disturbes the wave)
and the outlet boundary $x=L_x$ is an important parameter.

===== Open outlet boundary: absorbing layer =====

Instead of using a condition $u_t + \sqrt{q}u_x=0$, which is exact only
for plane waves propagating in $x$ direction, one can add an
artificial domain $[L_x,L_x+\delta]\times [0,L_y]$ where waves are
sufficiently damped and absorbed. The goal of an open boundary condition
is to avoid waves being reflected back into the domain. Turn on
the damping parameter $b$ in $[L_x,L_x+\delta]\times [0,L_y]$,
and test if it is wise to vary $b$, say in a linear or exponential
fashion to have a smooth transition from $b=0$ in the physical
domain and to some significant (efficient) $b$ value towards the
artificial boundary $x=L_x+\delta$.


===== Compiled loops =====

Extend the program with compiled loops using one or more of the
following techniques:

 * Cython code
 * Fortran code interfaced via `f2py`
 * C code interfaced via Cython or `f2py`
 * C/C++ code interfaced via `scipy.weave`
 * C/C++ code interfaced via "Instant": "https://launchpad.net/instant"

Note that Instant comes with FEniCS (`sudo apt-get install fenics` on
Ubuntu will install Instant) and it is described in the
"FEniCS book": "https://launchpad.net/fenics-book".

===== Parallel computing =====

Make a parallel version of the program using different approaches:

 * Automatic OpenMP code in migrated Cython loops using
   "`cython.parallel`": "http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/parallelism.html"
 * OpenMP in migrated C or Fortran loops
 * MPI in migrated C or Fortran loops
 * mpi4py MPI programming from Python (distribute vectorized code)
 * Automatic parallelization of vectorized NumPy code via
   "NumbaPro": "http://docs.continuum.io/numbapro/" (a license can be
   made available)
