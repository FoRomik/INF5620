===== Project: Nonlinear diffusion equation =====

Project size: approximately 40 h. This particular project will have
significant overlap with topics for the final exam.

The goal of this project is to discuss various numerical aspects of
a nonlinear diffusion model:

!bt
\[ \varrho u_t = \nabla\cdot (\alpha (u)\nabla u) + f(\pmb{x}, t),\]
!et
with initial condition $u(\pmb{x},0)=I(x)$ and boundary condition
$\partial u/\partial n=0$. The coefficiet $\varrho$ is constant
and $\alpha(u)$ is a known function of $u$.

!bsubex
Introduce some finite difference approximation in time that leads
to an implicit scheme (say a Backward Euler, Crank-Nicolson, or 2-step
backward scheme).
Derive a variational formulation of the initial condition
and the spatial problem to be solved at each time step (and at
the first time step in case of a 2-step backward scheme).
!esubex

!bsubex
Formulate a Picard iteration method at the PDE level, using
the most recently computed $u$ function in the $\alpha(u)$
coefficient. Derive general formulas for the entries in the linear system to be
solved in each Picard iteration.
Use the solution at the previous time step as initial guess for the
Picard iteration.
!esubex

!bsubex
Restrict the Picard iteration to a single iteration. That is,
simply use a $u$ value from the previous time step in the $\alpha(u)$
coefficient. Implement this method with the aid of
the FEniCS software (in a dimension-independent
way).
!esubex

!bsubex
The first verification of the FEniCS implementation may assmue
$\alpha (u)=1$, $f=0$, $\Omega = [0,1]\times [0,1]$, P1 elements, and
$I(x,y)= \cos (\pi x)$. The exact solution is then
$u(x,y,t)=e^{-\pi^2 t}\cos (\pi x)$. The error
in space is then ${\cal O}(\Delta x^2) + {\cal O}(\Delta y^2)$,
while the error in time is ${\cal O}(\Delta t^p)$, with $p=1$ for
the Backward Euler scheme and $p=2$ for the Crank-Nicolson or the 2-step
backward schemes. Set $h=\Delta t^p = \Delta x^2$ and perform a
convergence rate study as $h$ is decreased. A measure of the error $E$ can be
computed by

!bc pycod
e = u_e.vector().array() - u.vector().array()
E = numpy.sqrt(numpy.sum(e**2)/u.vector().array().size)
!ec
for some fixed point of time, say $t=0.05$.
Here, `u_e` is a projection of the exact solution onto the function
space used for `u`.

Show that $E/h$
remains approximately constant as the mesh in space and time is
simultaneously refined.

!bsubex
To get an indication whether the implementation of the nonlinear
diffusion PDE is correct or not,
we can use the *method of manufactured solutions*. Say we restrict
the problem to one space dimension, $\Omega=[0,1]$, and choose
!bt
\[ u(x,t) = t\int_0^x q(1-q)dq = tx^2\left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{x}{3}\right)\]
!et
and $\alpha(u) = 1+u^2$.
The following `sympy` session computes an $f(x,t)$ such that the above $u$
is a solution of the PDE problem:

!bc pycod
>>> from sympy import *
>>> x, t, rho, dt = symbols('x t rho dt')
>>>
>>> def a(u):
...     return 1 + u**2
...
>>> def u_simple(x, t):
...     return x**2*(Rational(1,2) - x/3)*t
...
>>> # Show that u_simple satisfies the BCs
>>> for x_point in 0, 1:
...     print 'u_x(%s,t):' % x_point,
...     print diff(u_simple(x, t), x).subs(x, x_point).simplify()
...
u_x(0,t): 0
u_x(1,t): 0
>>> print 'Initial condition:', u_simple(x, 0)
Initial condition: 0
>>>
>>> # MMS: full nonlinear problem
>>> u = u_simple(x, t)
>>> f = rho*diff(u, t) - diff(a(u)*diff(u, x), x)
>>> print f.simplify()
-rho*x**3/3 + rho*x**2/2 + 8*t**3*x**7/9 - 28*t**3*x**6/9 +
7*t**3*x**5/2 - 5*t**3*x**4/4 + 2*t*x - t
!ec
Compare the FEniCS solution and the $u$ given above as a function of $x$
for several values of $t$.

!bsubex
List the difference sources of numerical errors in the FEniCS program.
!esubex

!bsubex
(Can be postponed.)
To verify the nonlinear PDE implementation in FEniCS, we can eliminate
the error due to a single Picard iteration by computing
a manufactured solution corresponding to $\alpha (u_1)$, where
$u_1$ is the finite element function representation of the solution
at the previous time step.

!bc pycod
>>> u_1 = u_simple(x, t-dt)
>>> f = rho*diff(u, t) - diff(a(u_1)*diff(u, x), x)
>>> print f.simplify()
rho*x**2*(-2*x + 3)/6 -
(-12*t*x + 3*t*(-2*x + 3))*(x**4*(-dt + t)**2*(-2*x + 3)**2 + 36)/324
- (-6*t*x**2 + 6*t*x*(-2*x + 3))*(36*x**4*(-dt + t)**2*(2*x - 3)
+ 36*x**3*(-dt + t)**2*(-2*x + 3)**2)/5832
!ec
Perform a convergence rate test by decreasing $h=\Delta t^p = \Delta x^2$.
!esubex

!bsubex
Simulate the nonlinear diffusion of Gaussian function. Due to symmetry,
it suffices to simulate one quarter of the domain:

!bt
\[
I(x,y) = \exp{\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\left( x^2 + y^2 \right)\right)},
\quad (x,y)\in\Omega = [0,1]\times [0,1],
\]
!et
where $\sigma$ measures the width of the Gaussian function.
Choose $\alpha(u) = 1+\beta u^2$, where $\beta$ is a constant one can
play around with.

The rest of the exercise is theoretical and not directly related to
the FEniCS implementation.
