TITLE: Background Questionnaire for INF5620
AUTHOR: Hans Petter Langtangen
DATE: today

The purpose of the following test is to map out the students'
background in mathematics, numerical methods, and programming when
they come to INF5620. Solve the exercises on a piece of paper and give
it to Joakim BÃ¸ or Hans Petter Langtangen by Aug 26, 2013.  Don't
write your name on the solution -- the purpose is not to uncover the
knowledge of the individual student but the group as a whole.

In what subject is your master's or phd thesis? Any need for solving
specific PDEs or learning specific tools for scientific computing?


======= Differentiation =======

__1.__ Differentiate the function
!bt
\begin{equation*} u(x,t) = A\exp{(ik(x-ct))}\end{equation*}
!et
with respect to $t$.
($i$ is the imaginary unit: $i=\sqrt{-1}$).


__2.__ You know the three values $y(0)$, $y(0.25)$, and $y(0.5)$ of
some function $y(t)$. How can you compute $dy/dt$ at these three
points?

======= Integration =======

__3.__ Describe how you would compute the integral
!bt
\begin{equation*} \int_{0}^1 e^{-t^2}dt .\end{equation*}
!et

======= Ordinary differential equations =======

__4.__ Describe how you would solve
the ordinary differential equation problem
!bt
\begin{equation*} u^{-1}u' + 1 = 0,\quad u(0)=1.\end{equation*}
!et

======= Nonlinear equations =======

__5.__ Formulate Newton's method for solving
!bt
\begin{equation*} w + c\Delta t w^2 = u,\end{equation*}
!et
with respect to $w$.

__6.__ Implement the algorithm in Exercise 5 in your favorite
programming language (just sketch the program on paper).

======= Scalar and vector fields =======

__7.__ Compute the divergence of the gradient of the scalar
field $u(x,y)=\sin\pi x\sin\pi y$, i.e., $\nabla\cdot(\nabla u)$.


======= Partial differential equations =======

__8.__ Formulate a numerical method for solving
!bt
\begin{equation*} \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
\quad x\in (0,1),\ t>0,\end{equation*}
!et
where $k>0$ is a constant. The initial condition reads $u(x,t)=1$, while
we set $u(0)=u(1)=0$ as boundary conditions.

__9.__ What is the most complicated partial differential equation
problem you have solved, or seen be solved by a lecturer?

======= Physical modeling =======

__11.__ Give a physical interpretation of $u$ in the equations below.
!bt
\[ \frac{du}{dt}=-au\]
\[ \frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + \omega^2 u = 0\]
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\]
\[ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u\]
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} =0\]
\[ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = (\lambda +\mu)\nabla(\nabla\cdot u) + \mu\nabla^2 u\]
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u\nabla u = -\nabla p + \frac{1}{\hbox{Re}}\nabla^2 u,\quad \nabla\cdot u = 0\]
!et

__12.__ Given a vector field ${\bf v}(_x_, t)$
describing the velocity of some flowing material,
what is the physical interpretation of $\int_\Gamma {\bf v}\cdot{\bf n}ds$?
$\Gamma$ is some closed 3D surface and $\bf n$ is the unit outward normal vector
to this surface.

__13.__ In Exercise 11, transform the surface integral to
a volume integral and use the result to give a physical interpretation
of the divergence of $\bf v$.
