 * Sep 13: other schemes, the general u'=f(u,t) problem, 2nd-order ODE for vibrations ("vib"), the 1D wave equation PDE. Preliminary compact slide-style documents for the "decay": "../notes/lecture_decay.html" and "vib": "../notes/lecture_vib.html" themes have been generated. For the 1D wave equation, see "handwritings": "handwritings/H12/Sep13.pdf". "Exercises 24": "http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/notes/decay-sphinx/main_decay.html#exercise-24-make-a-program-for-vertical-motion-in-a-fluid", 25, 26, and 27 are solved by Yapi and his group.
 * Sep 20: Analysis of the scheme for the 1D wave equation, stability,
   extension to 2D, boundary conditions, variable coefficient (wave velocity).
   "Handwritings": "handwritings/H12/Sep20_27.pdf". Nina and Ingeborg solved
   the Leapfrog exercises.

   (du/dn=0), 2D, about the compulsory project. Qualitative behavior
   of the scheme for different wave shapes and  abrupt changes in the wave
   velocity. About debugging in the project. Implementation: vectorization,
   Cython code, Fortran code (very briefly).

   Lecture by Dag Sverre Seljebotn. Material is available
   from "GitHub": "https://github.com/dagss/computer-tutorial".
 * Nov 1, 14.15-18.00:
   "What is the reason for noise in wave equations with constant
   wave velocity and how does it relate to the initial condition?": "handwritings/H12/Nov1.pdf". See also the
   previous "numerical dispersion analysis": "http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/notes/wave-sphinx/main_wave.html#analysis-of-the-continuous-and-discrete-solutions" for more detailed mathematics.
   More about function approximation and the finite element method:
   definition of finite elements,
   approximation, element matrices and
   vectors, assembly, variational formulations, essential and natural
   boundary conditions, examples from 1D differential equations,
   extensions to 2D and 3D.

   and "HTML solarized": "../notes/lecture_fem-solarized.html".
 * Nov 8, 14.15-18.00: More about variational formulations and solving
   PDEs with finite elements. See "brief, slide-style lecture notes": "HTML": "../notes/lecture_fem.html" and "HTML solarized": "../notes/lecture_fem-solarized.html" of the full lecture notes. The diffusion equation solved by finite
   differences (Forward Euler, Backward Euler, Crank-Nicolson).
   Time-dependent problems and the finite element method, examples on the
   diffusion equation: "part I": "handwritings/H12/Nov8a.pdf" and "part II": "handwritings/H12/Nov8b.pdf".
