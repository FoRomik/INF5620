The teaching material is produced in various formats for printing and
on-screen reading.

The PDF files are based on LaTeX and have seldom technical
failures that cannot be easily corrected.
The HTML-based files, called "HTML" and "Sphinx", apply MathJax
for rendering LaTeX formulas and this gives sometimes rise
to unexpected failures (e.g., correct syntax in formulas, still
incorrect rendering in a web page). Consult the corresponding PDF
file if you find missing or incorrectly rendered
formulas in HTML or Sphinx files. It is also a problem that
splitting HTML and Sphinx files may lead to missing equation
references.

======= Preliminary notes =======

 * The "decay" problem for decay ODEs: "LaTeX PDF for printing": "../notes/main_decay.pdf", "plain HTML": "../notes/main_decay.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/main_decay-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../notes/decay-sphinx/index.html" (updated H13)

 * The "vib" problem for vibration ODEs: "LaTeX PDF": "../notes/main_vib.pdf", "plain HTML": "../notes/main_vib.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/main_vib-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../notes/vib-sphinx/index.html"

These are from H12 and will be significantly updated:

 * The "wave" problem for wave equations: "LaTeX PDF": "../notes/main_wave.pdf", "plain HTML": "../notes/main_wave.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/main_wave-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../notes/wave-sphinx/index.html" (old version H12, will be updated)

#Note: some of the mathematics is not rendered correctly by MathJax in the HTML versions so the PDF version from LaTeX is the safest choice until the mathematics in HTML is rewritten.

 * Basic finite element methods ("fem"): "LaTeX PDF": "../notes/main_fem.pdf", "plain HTML": "../notes/main_fem.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/main_fem-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../notes/fem-sphinx/index.html" (old version H12, will be updated)

 * Preliminary notes on methods for diffusion equations: "LaTeX PDF": "../notes/main_diffu.pdf", "plain HTML": "../notes/main_diffu.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/main_diffu-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../notes/diffu-sphinx/index.html" (old version H12, will be updated)

 * Preliminary notes on methods for the Navier-Stokes equations: "LaTeX PDF": "../notes/main_ns.pdf", "plain HTML": "../notes/main_ns.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/main_ns-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../notes/ns-sphinx/index.html" (old version H12, will be updated)

#Note: some of the mathematics is not rendered correctly by MathJax in the HTML versions so the PDF version from LaTeX is the safest choice until the mathematics in HTML is rewritten.

======= Study guides =======

The study guides are summaries of the main points in the course
material. The guides are made such that they can be used as
slides in lectures.

 * From the "decay" model problem: "plain HTML": "../notes/lecture_decay.html", "plain HTML (1 big file)": "../notes/lecture_decay-1.html", "solarized HTML (1 big file)": "../notes/lecture_decay-solarized.html", "Beamer slides": "../notes/lecture_decay-beamer.pdf", "Reveal slides": "../notes/lecture_decay-reveal.html", "Deck slides": "../notes/lecture_decay-deck.html", "PDF for printing": "../notes/lecture_decay.pdf"

These are from H12 and will be significantly updated:

 * From the "vib" model problem (still incomplete): "plain HTML": "../notes/lecture_vib.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/lecture_vib-solarized.html"
 * From the introductory finite element material ("fem"): "plain HTML": "../notes/lecture_fem.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/lecture_fem-solarized.html"
 * From analyzing finite difference schemes for diffusion equations: "plain HTML": "../notes/lecture_diffu.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/lecture_diffu-solarized.html"
 * From methods for the Navier-Stokes equations: "plain HTML": "../notes/lecture_ns.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/lecture_ns-solarized.html"
