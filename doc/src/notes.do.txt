======= Very preliminary notes =======

 * The "decay" problem for decay ODEs: "LaTeX PDF": "../notes/main_decay.pdf", "plain HTML": "../notes/main_decay.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/main_decay-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../notes/decay-sphinx/index.html"

 * The "vib" problem for vibration ODEs: "LaTeX PDF": "../notes/main_vib.pdf", "plain HTML": "../notes/main_vib.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/main_vib-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../notes/vib-sphinx/index.html"

 * The "wave" problem for wave equations: "LaTeX PDF": "../notes/main_wave.pdf", "plain HTML": "../notes/main_wave.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/main_wave-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../notes/wave-sphinx/index.html".

#Note: some of the mathematics is not rendered correctly by MathJax in the HTML versions so the PDF version from LaTeX is the safest choice until the mathematics in HTML is rewritten.

 * Basic finite element methods ("fem"): "LaTeX PDF": "../notes/main_fem.pdf", "plain HTML": "../notes/main_fem.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/main_fem-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../notes/fem-sphinx/index.html".

 * Preliminary notes on methods for diffusion equations: "LaTeX PDF": "../notes/main_diffu.pdf", "plain HTML": "../notes/main_diffu.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/main_diffu-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../notes/diffu-sphinx/index.html".

 * Preliminary notes on methods for the Navier-Stokes equations: "LaTeX PDF": "../notes/main_ns.pdf", "plain HTML": "../notes/main_ns.html", "solarized HTML": "../notes/main_ns-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../notes/ns-sphinx/index.html".
