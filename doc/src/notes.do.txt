!bwarning
The teaching material is produced in various formats for printing and
on-screen reading.

The PDF files are based on LaTeX and have seldom technical
failures that cannot be easily corrected.
The HTML-based files, called "HTML" and "Sphinx", apply MathJax
for rendering LaTeX formulas and sometimes this gives rise
to unexpected failures (e.g.,
incorrect rendering in a web page despite correct LaTeX syntax in the
formula). Consult the corresponding PDF
file if you find missing or incorrectly rendered
formulas in HTML or Sphinx files. It is also a problem that
splitting HTML and Sphinx files may lead to missing equation
references.

======= Preliminary notes =======

=== Introduction to computing with finite difference methods ===

${text_types("decay")}

=== Finite difference methods for vibration ODEs ===

${text_types("vib")}

=== Truncation error analysis ===

${text_types("trunc")}

=== Finite difference methods for wave motion ===

${text_types("wave")}

=== Approximation of functions with finite elements ===

${text_types("fem_approx")}

The following documents are from H12 and will be significantly updated:

#Note: some of the mathematics is not rendered correctly by MathJax in the HTML versions so the PDF version from LaTeX is the safest choice until the mathematics in HTML is rewritten.

 * Basic finite element methods ("fem"): "LaTeX PDF": "../pub/main_fem.pdf", "plain HTML": "../pub/main_fem.html", "solarized HTML": "../pub/main_fem-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../pub/sphinx-fem/index.html" (first part on approximation is updated H13)

 * Finite difference methods for diffusion equations: "LaTeX PDF": "../pub/main_diffu.pdf", "plain HTML": "../pub/main_diffu.html", "solarized HTML": "../pub/main_diffu-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../pub/sphinx-diffu/index.html"

 * Preliminary notes on methods for the Navier-Stokes equations: "LaTeX PDF": "../pub/main_ns.pdf", "plain HTML": "../pub/main_ns.html", "solarized HTML": "../pub/main_ns-solarized.html", "Sphinx": "../pub/sphinx-ns/index.html"

======= Study guides (lectures) =======

The study guides are summaries of the main points in the course
material. The guides are made such that they can be used as
slides in lectures.
