======= Plan for the course =======

 * Monday 10.15-11.50: mainly lectures.
 * Wednesday 8.15-9.00: exercise lab.
 * Wednesday 9.15-10.00: presentation of exercises, sometimes lectures.
 * "Quick summary of lectures": "lectures.html" are
   updated after each lecture (if not, send email to `hpl at
   simula.no`)
 * Preparations to lectures will be possible if the corresponding
   "course notes": "notes.html" are available, see the "Quick
   summary of lectures": "lectures.html" for
   announcements of topics.
 * A project, consisting of some related exercises, is solved by
   a small student group (2-3 students) almost every week.
   The solution becomes available as a program on
   "GitHub": "http://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/". Others are also
   encouraged to try to solve these projects.
   Those who send in a satisfactory solution in email before the
   project is presented, can get 1 credit point per exercise.
   See the Homework section on the "main page": "index.html" for
   announcement of exercises.
 * A "project with the finite differences and the wave equation": "oblig1.html",
   counting 5 credit points, must be done by groups of students.
 * A "project with finite elements and the wave equation": "oblig2.html",
   counting 5 credit points, is highy recommended to do on individual basis
   to learn the finite element method.
 * A final student-chosen project, with work approximately equal to 60 hours,
   should be approved before  the exam.
   This project counts 10 credit points. Normally, this
   final project is about solving a PDE or system of PDEs by the finite
   element method with aid of the FEniCS package.
   It is optimal to find a project that can overlap with thesis work
   or other courses (using alternative methods for comparison).
   A "default project": "default_project.html" exists.
 * Each student should reach a total of at least 20 credit points
   (i.e., 5 exercises, 1 wave PDE project and 1 student-chosen final
   project).  The PDE project may be replaced by a set of exercises
   when students have done a similar project in other courses.
