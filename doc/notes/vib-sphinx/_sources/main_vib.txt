Vibration problems lead to differential equations with solutions that
oscillates in time, typically in a damped or undamped sinusoidal
fashion.  Such solutions put certain demands on the numerical methods
compared to, e.g., solutions with exponential, non-oscillating decay.
Both the frequency and amplitude of the oscillations need to be
accurately handled by the numerical schemes. Most of the reasoning and
specific building blocks introduced in the fortcoming text can be
reused to construct sound methods for partial differential equations
of wave nature in multiple spatial dimensions.

Finite difference methods for a vibration problem
=================================================


.. index:: period (of oscillations)


.. index:: frequency (of oscillations)


.. index:: Hz (unit)


Much of the numerical challenges with computing oscillatory
solutions in ODEs and PDEs can be captured by the very simple
ODE :math:`u'' + u =` and this is therefore the starting point for
method development, implementation, and analysis.

A basic model for vibrations
----------------------------

A system that vibrates without damping and external forcing
can be described by ODE problem


.. math::
   :label: vib:ode1
        
        u'' + \omega^2u = 0,\quad u(0)=I,\ u'(0)=0,\ t\in (0,T]
        \thinspace .
        
        

Here, :math:`\omega` and :math:`I` are given constants.
The exact solution of :eq:`vib:ode1` is


.. math::
   :label: vib:ode1:uex
        
        u(t) = I\cos (\omega t)
        \thinspace .
        
        

That is, :math:`u` oscillates with constant amplitude :math:`I` and
(angular) frequency :math:`\omega`.
The corresponding period of oscillations (e.g., the time between two
neighboring peaks in the cosine function) is :math:`P=2\pi/\omega`.
The number of periods per second
is :math:`f=\omega/(2\pi)` and measured in the unit Hz.
Both :math:`f` and :math:`\omega` are referred to as frequency. The latter
is not measured in Hz, but in radians per second.

In vibrating mechanical systems modeled by :eq:`vib:ode1`, :math:`u(t)`
very often represents a position or a displacement of a particular
point in the system. The derivative :math:`u'(t)` then has the
interpretation of the point's velocity, and :math:`u''(t)` is the associated
acceleration.  We remark that the model :eq:`vib:ode1` is not only
applicable to vibrating mechanical systems, but also to oscillations
in electrical circuits.

.. _vib:ode1:fdm:

A centered finite difference scheme
-----------------------------------

To formulate a finite difference method for the model
problem  :eq:`vib:ode1` we follow the `four steps <http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/notes/decay-sphinx/main_decay.html#the-forward-euler-scheme>`_ in [Langtangen:deq:decay]_.

Step 1: Discretizing the domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The domain is discretized by
introducing a uniformly partitioned time mesh in the present problem.
The points in the mesh are hence :math:`t_n=n\Delta t`, :math:`n=0,1,\ldots,N`,
where :math:`\Delta t = T/N` is the constant length of the time steps.

Step 2: Fulfilling the equation at discrete time points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ODE is to be satisfied at each mesh point:


.. math::
   :label: vib:ode1:step2
        
        u''(t_n) + \omega^2u(t_n) = 0,\quad n=1,\ldots,N
        \thinspace .
        
        


Step 3: Replacing derivatives by finite differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The derivative :math:`u''(t_n)` is to be replaced by a finite
difference approximation. A common second-order accurate approximation
to the second-order derivative is


.. math::
   :label: vib:ode1:step3
        
        u''(t_n) \approx \frac{u^{n+1}-2u^n + u^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
        \thinspace .
        
        

Inserting :eq:`vib:ode1:step3` in :eq:`vib:ode1:step2`
yields


.. math::
   :label: vib:ode1:step3b
        
        \frac{u^{n+1}-2u^n + u^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2} = -\omega^2 u^n
        \thinspace .
        
        


We also need to replace the derivative in the initial condition by
a finite difference. Here we choose a centered difference:


.. math::
   :label: vib:ode1:step3c
        
        \frac{u^1-u^{-1}}{2\Delta t} = 0
        
        \thinspace .
        


Step 4: Formulating a recursive algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To formulate the computational algorithm, we assume that we
have already computed :math:`u^{n-1}` and :math:`u^n` such that :math:`u^{n-1}` is the
unknown value, which we can readily solve for:


.. math::
   :label: vib:ode1:step4
        
        u^{n+1} = 2u^n - u^{n-1} - \omega^2 u^n
        \thinspace .
        
        

The computational algorithm is simply to apply :eq:`vib:ode1:step4`
successively for :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N-1`. This numerical scheme sometimes
goes under the name
Stormer's
method or `Verlet integration <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_Verlet>`_.

Computing the first step
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We observe that :eq:`vib:ode1:step4` cannot be used for :math:`n=0` since
the computation of :math:`u^1` then involves the undefined value :math:`u^{-1}`
at :math:`t=-\Delta t`. The discretization of the initial condition
then come to rescue: :eq:`vib:ode1:step3c` implies :math:`u^{-1} = u^1`
and this relation can be combined with :eq:`vib:ode1:step4`
for :math:`n=1` to yield a value for :math:`u^1`:


.. math::
         u^1 = 2u^0 - u^{1} - \Delta t^2 \omega^2 u^0,

which reduces to


.. math::
   :label: vib:ode1:step4b
        
        u^1 = u^0 - \half \Delta t^2 \omega^2 u^0
        \thinspace .
        
        

:ref:`vib:exer:step4b:alt` asks you to perform an alternative derivation
and also to generalize the initial condition to :math:`u'(0)=V\neq 0`.

The computational algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The steps for solving :eq:`vib:ode1` becomes

 1. :math:`u^0=I`

 2. compute :math:`u^1` from :eq:`vib:ode1:step4b`

 3. for :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N-1`:

   1. compute :math:`u^{n+1}` from :eq:`vib:ode1:step4`


The algorithm is more precisely expressed directly in Python:


.. code-block:: python

        t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # mesh points in time
        dt = t[1] - t[0]         # constant time step.
        u = zeros(N+1)           # solution
        
        u[0] = I
        u[1] = u[0] - 0.5*dt**2*w**2*u[0]
        for n in range(1,N):
            u[n+1] = 2*u[n] - u[n-1] - dt**2*w**2*u[n]

We remark that ``w`` is used as symbol in the code for :math:`\omega`.
The reason is that this author prefers ``w`` for readability
and comparison with the mathematical :math:`\omega` instead of
the full word ``omega`` as variable name.

Operator notation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We may write the scheme using the compact difference notation
(see 
`examples <http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/notes/decay-sphinx/main_decay.html#compact-operator-notation-for-finite-differences>`_ in cite{Langtangen:deq:decay). The difference :eq:`vib:ode1:step3` has the operator
notation :math:`[D_tD_t u]^n` such that we can write:


.. math::
   :label: vib:ode1:step4:op
        
        [D_tD_t u  + \omega^2 u = 0]^n
        \thinspace .
        
        

Note that :math:`[D_tD_t u]^n` means applying a central difference with step :math:`\Delta t/2` twice:


.. math::
         [D_t(D_t u)]^n = \frac{[D_t u]^{n+1/2} - [D_t u]^{n-1/2}}{\Delta t}

which is written out as

.. math::
        
        \frac{1}{\Delta t}\left(\frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t} - \frac{u^{n}-u^{n-1}}{\Delta t}\right) = \frac{u^{n+1}-2u^n + u^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
        \thinspace .
        


The discretization of initial conditions can in the operator notation
be expressed as

.. math::
        
        [u = I]^0,\quad [D_{2t} u = 0]^0,
        

where the operator :math:`[D_{2t} u]^n` is defined as

.. math::
        
        [D_{2t} u]^n = \frac{u^{n+1} - u^{n-1}}{2\Delta t}
        \thinspace .
        


Computing :math:`u'`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In mechanical vibration applications one is often interested in
computing the velocity :math:`u'(t)` after :math:`u(t)` has been computed.
This can be done by a central difference,


.. math::
        
        u'(t_n) \approx \frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n-1}}{2\Delta t} = [D_{2t}u]^n
        \thinspace .
        



.. _vib:impl1:

Implementation
==============

Making a solver function
------------------------

The algorithm from the previous section is readily translated to
a complete Python function for computing (returning)
:math:`u^0,u^1,\ldots,n^N` and :math:`t_0,t_1,\ldots,t_N`, given the
input :math:`I`, :math:`\omega`, :math:`\Delta t`, and :math:`T`:


.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import *
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        
        def solver(I, w, dt, T):
            """
            Solve u'' + w**2*u = 0 for t in (0,T], u(0)=I and u'(0)=0,
            by a central finite difference method with time step dt.
            """
            dt = float(dt)
            N = int(round(T/dt))
            u = zeros(N+1)
            t = linspace(0, N*dt, N+1)
        
            u[0] = I
            u[1] = u[0] - 0.5*dt**2*w**2*u[0]
            for n in range(1,N):
                u[n+1] = 2*u[n] - u[n-1] - dt**2*w**2*u[n]
            return u, t


A function for plotting the numerical and the exact solution is also
convenient to have:


.. code-block:: python

        def exact_solution(t, I, w):
            return I*cos(w*t)
        
        def visualize(u, t, I, w):
            plot(t, u, 'r--o')
            t_fine = linspace(0, t[-1], 1001)  # very fine mesh for u_e
            u_e = exact_solution(t_fine, I, w)
            hold('on')
            plot(t_fine, u_e, 'b-')
            legend(['numerical', 'exact'], loc='upper left')
            xlabel('t')
            ylabel('u')
            dt = t[1] - t[0]
            title('dt=%g' % dt)
            umin = 1.2*u.min();  umax = -umin
            axis([t[0], t[-1], umin, umax])
            savefig('vib1.png')
            savefig('vib1.pdf')
            savefig('vib1.eps')

A corresponding main program calling these functions for a simulation
of a given number of periods (``num_periods``) may take the form


.. code-block:: python

        I = 1
        w = 2*pi
        dt = 0.05
        num_periods = 5
        P = 2*pi/w    #  one period
        T = P*num_periods
        u, t = solver(I, w, dt, T)
        visualize(u, t, I, w, dt)


Adjusting some of the input parameters on the command line can be
handy. Here is a code segment using the ``ArgumentParser`` tool in
the ``argparse`` module to define option value (``--option value``)
pairs on the command line:


.. code-block:: python

        import argparse
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument('--I', type=float, default=1.0)
        parser.add_argument('--w', type=float, default=2*pi)
        parser.add_argument('--dt', type=float, default=0.05)
        parser.add_argument('--num_periods', type=int, default=5)
        a = parser.parse_args()
        I, w, dt, num_periods = a.I, a.w, a.dt, a.num_periods


.. _vib:ode1:verify:

Verification
------------

Manual calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest type of verification, which is also instructive for understanding
the algorithm, is to compute :math:`u^1` and :math:`u^2` with the aid of a calculator
and make a function for comparing these results with those from the ``solver``
function. We refer to the ``test_three_steps`` function in
the file `vb_undamped.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/vib/vb_undamped.py>`_
for details.

Testing very simple solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Constructing test problems where the exact solution is constant or linear
helps initial debugging and verification as one expects any reasonable
numerical method to reproduce such solutions to machine precision.
We would, however, need a source term :math:`f(t)` in the equation,
:math:`u'' +\omega^2 u = f(t)`, to have a constant solution more complicated
than the not so useful :math:`u=0`, or a linear solution. See
:ref:`vib:exer:verify:linear` for how to extend the problem
so that the code can be debugged with constant and linear solutions.

Checking convergence rates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Empirical computation of convergence rates, as explained
in for an `ODE model <http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/notes/decay-sphinx/main_decay.html#computing-convergence-rates>`_, yields a good method for
verification. The function below

 * performs :math:`m` simulations with halved time steps: :math:`2^{-k}\Delta t`, :math:`k=0,\ldots,m-1`,

 * computes the :math:`L_2` norm of the error,
   :math:`E=\sqrt{\Delta t_i\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}(u^n-u_{\small\mbox{e}}(t_n))^2}` in each case,

 * estimates the rates :math:`r_i` from two consecutive
   experiments :math:`(\Delta t_{i-1}, E_{i-1})` and :math:`(\Delta t_{i}, E_{i})`,
   assuming :math:`E_i=C\Delta t_i^{r_i}` and :math:`E_{i-1}=C\Delta t_{i-1}^{r_i}`:

The implementational details goes as follows:


.. code-block:: python

        def convergence_rates(m, num_periods=8):
            """
            Return m-1 empirical estimates of the convergence rate
            based on m simulations, where the time step is halved
            for each simulation.
            """
            w = 0.35; I = 0.3
            dt = 2*pi/w/30  # 30 time step per period 2*pi/w
            T = 2*pi/w*num_periods
            dt_values = []
            E_values = []
            for i in range(m):
                u, t = solver(I, w, dt, T)
                u_e = exact_solution(t, I, w)
                E = sqrt(dt*sum((u_e-u)**2))
                dt_values.append(dt)
                E_values.append(E)
                dt = dt/2
        
            r = [log(E_values[i-1]/E_values[i])/
                 log(dt_values[i-1]/dt_values[i])
                 for i in range(1, m, 1)]
            return r

The return ``r`` list has its values equal to 2.00, which is in
excellent agreement with what is
expected from the second-order finite difference approximation :math:`[D_tD_tu]^n`.
The final ``r[-1]`` value is a good candidate for a unit test:


.. code-block:: python

        def test_convergence_rates():
            r = convergence_rates(m=5, num_periods=8)
            # Accept rate to 1 decimal place
            nt.assert_almost_equal(r[-1], 2.0, places=1)

The complete code appears in `vb_undamped.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/vib/vb_undamped.py>`_.

.. _vib:ode1:longseries:

Long-time simulations
=====================

Figure :ref:`vib:ode1:2dt` shows a comparison of the exact and numerical
solution for :math:`\Delta t=0.1, 0.05` and :math:`w=2\pi`.
From the plot we make the following observations:

 * The numerical solution seems to have right amplitude.

 * There is a phase error which is reduced by reducing the time step.

 * The total phase error grows with time.

.. _vib:ode1:2dt:

.. figure:: fig-vib/vib_phase_err1.png
   :width: 600

   *Effect of halving the time step*


Using a moving plot window
--------------------------

In vibration problems it is often of interest to investigate the system's
behavior over long time intervals. Errors in the phase may then show
up as crucial. Let us investigate long
time series by introducing a moving plot window that can move along with
the :math:`p` most recently computed periods of the solution. The
`SciTools <http://code.google.com/p/scitools>`_ package contains
a convenient tool for this: ``MovingPlotWindow``. Typing
``pydoc scitools.MovingPlotWindow`` shows a demo and description of usage.
The function below illustrates the usage and is invoked in the
``vb_undamped.py`` code if the number of periods in the simulation exceeds
10:


.. code-block:: python

        def visualize_front(u, t, I, w, savefig=False):
            """
            Visualize u and the exact solution vs t, using a
            moving plot window and continuous drawing of the
            curves as they evolve in time.
            Makes it easy to plot very long time series.
            """
            import scitools.std as st
            from scitools.MovingPlotWindow import MovingPlotWindow
        
            P = 2*pi/w  # one period
            umin = 1.2*u.min();  umax = -umin
            plot_manager = MovingPlotWindow(
                window_width=8*P,
                dt=t[1]-t[0],
                yaxis=[umin, umax],
                mode='continuous drawing')
            for n in range(1,len(u)):
                if plot_manager.plot(n):
                    s = plot_manager.first_index_in_plot
                    st.plot(t[s:n+1], u[s:n+1], 'r-1',
                            t[s:n+1], I*cos(w*t)[s:n+1], 'b-1',
                            title='t=%6.3f' % t[n],
                            axis=plot_manager.axis(),
                            show=not savefig) # drop window if savefig
                    if savefig:
                        st.savefig('tmp_vib%04d.png' % n)
                plot_manager.update(n)


Running

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python vb_undamped.py --dt 0.05 --num_periods 40

makes the simulation last for 40 periods of the cosine function.
With the moving plot window we can follow the numerical and exact
solution as time progresses, and we see from this demo that
the phase error is small in the beginning, but then becomes more
prominent with time. Running ``vb_undamped.py`` with :math:`\Delta t=0.1`
clearly shows that the phase errors become significant even earlier
in the time series and destroys the solution.

Making a movie file
-------------------


.. index:: making movies


.. index:: scitools movie command


The ``visualize_font`` function stores all the plots in
files with names ``tmp_vib0000.png``, ``tmp_vib0001.png``, ``tmp_vib0002.png``,
and so on. From these files we may make a movie. This is particularly
easy and convenient with the ``scitools movie`` command. The simplest
movie format is a web page where the PNG files can be displayed consecutively.
The generation of such a web page goes like

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> scitools movie output_file=vib.html fps=4 tmp_vib*.png

The ``fps`` argument controls the speed of the movie ("frames per second").
To ensure that the individual plot frames are shown in correct order,
it is important to number the files with zero-padded numbers
(0000, 0001, 0002, etc.). The printf format ``%04d`` specifies an
integer in a field of width 4, padded with zeros from the left.
A simple Unix wildcard file specification like ``tmp_vib*.png``
will then list the frames in the right order. (If the numbers in the
filenames were not zero-padded, ``tmp_vib11.png`` would appear
before ``tmp_vib2.png``!)

To watch the movie, load the movie file ``vib.html`` into some browser, e.g.,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> google-chrome vib.html  # invoke web page

Clicking on ``Start movie`` to see the result. Moving this movie to
some other place requires moving ``vib.html`` *and all the PNG files*
``tmp_vib*.png``:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> mkdir vib_dt0.1
        Terminal> mv tmp_vib*.png vib_dt0.1
        Terminal mv vib.html vib_dt0.1/index.html


The ``scitools movie`` command can make movies in different formats,
depending upon what software that is installed on the computer.
If you have the ``convert`` program from the ImageMagick suite, an
animated GIF file can be made by


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> scitools movie encoder=convert output_file=vib.gif \
                  fps=4 tmp_vib*.png

One can alternatively use ``convert`` directly:


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> convert -delay 25 tmp_vib*.png tmp_vib.gif

However, in this particular example with :math:`\Delta t=0.05` and 40 periods,
making an animated GIF file out of
the large number of PNG files is a very heavy process and not feasible.

Using a line-by-line ascii plotter
----------------------------------

Plotting functions vertically, line by line, in the terminal window
using ascii characters only is a simple, fast, and convenient
visualization technique for long time series (the time arrow points
downward). The tool
``scitools.avplotter.Plotter`` makes it easy to create such plots:


.. code-block:: python

        def visualize_front_ascii(u, t, I, w, fps=10):
            """
            Plot u and the exact solution vs t line by line in a
            terminal window (only using ascii characters).
            Makes it easy to plot very long time series.
            """
            from scitools.avplotter import Plotter
            import time
            P = 2*pi/w
            umin = 1.2*u.min();  umax = -umin
        
            p = Plotter(ymin=umin, ymax=umax, width=60, symbols='+o')
            for n in range(len(u)):
                print p.plot(t[n], u[n], I*cos(w*t[n])), \ 
                      '%.1f' % (t[n]/P)
                time.sleep(1/float(fps))

The call ``p.plot`` returns a line of text, with the :math:`t` axis marked and
a symbol ``+`` for the first function (``u``) and ``o`` for the second
function (the exact solution). Here we append this text
a time counter reflecting how many periods the current time point
corresponds to. A typical output (:math:`\omega =2\pi`, :math:`\Delta t=0.05`)
looks like this:


.. code-block:: python

                                      |                       o+      14.0

.. _vib:ode1:empirical:

Empirical analysis of the solution
----------------------------------

For oscillating functions like those in Figure :ref:`vib:ode1:2dt` we may
compute the amplitude and frequency (or period) empirically.
That is, we run through the discrete solution points :math:`(t_n, u_n)` and
find all maxima and minima points. The distance between two consecutive
maxima (or minima) points can be used as estimate of the local period,
while half the difference between the :math:`u` value at a maximum and a nearby
minimum gives an estimate of the local amplitude.

The local maxima are the points where

.. math::
        
        u^{n-1} < u^n > u^{n+1},\quad n=1,\ldots,N-1,
        

and the local minima are recognized by

.. math::
        
        u^{n-1} > u^n < u^{n+1},\quad n=1,\ldots,N-1
        \thinspace .
        

In computer code this becomes


.. code-block:: python

        def minmax(t, u):
            minima = []; maxima = []
            for n in range(1, len(u)-1, 1):
                if u[n-1] > u[n] < u[n+1]:
                    minima.append((t[n], u[n]))
                if u[n-1] < u[n] > u[n+1]:
                    maxima.append((t[n], u[n]))
            return minima, maxima

Note that the returned objects are list of tuples.

Let :math:`(t_i, e_i)`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,M-1`, be the sequence of all
the :math:`M` maxima points, where :math:`t_i`
is the time value and :math:`e_i` the corresponding :math:`u` value.
The local period can be defined as :math:`p_i=t_{i+1}-t_i`.
With Python syntax this reads


.. code-block:: python

        def periods(maxima):
            p = [extrema[n][0] - maxima[n-1][0]
                 for n in range(1, len(maxima))]
            return np.array(p)

The list ``p`` created by a list comprehension is converted to an array
since we probably want to compute with it, e.g., find the corresponding
frequencies ``2*pi/p``.

If :math:`(t_i, f_i)` denotes a minimum, the local amplitude :math:`a_i` can be
computed as :math:`a_i=|e_i-f_i|/2`:


.. code-block:: python

        def amplitudes(minima, maxima):
            a = [(abs(maxima[n][1] - minima[n][1]))/2.0
                 for n in range(min(len(minima),len(maxima)))]
            return np.array(a)

The code segments are found in the file `vb_empirical_analysis.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/vib/vb_empirical_analysis.py>`_.

When plotting ``p`` or ``a`` it is most natural to just have a counter
on the horizontal axis, because ``a[i]`` and ``p[i]`` correspond to
the :math:`i`-th amplitude estimate and the :math:`i`-th period estimate, respectively.
There is no unique time point associated with either of these estimate
since values at two different time points were compared.

In the analysis of very long time series, it is advantageous to
compute and plot ``p`` and ``a`` instead of :math:`u` to get an impression of
the development of the signal.

.. Use it for very long time integration of CN! And of RK4!


.. _vib:ode1:analysis:

Analysis of the numerical scheme
================================

Deriving an exact numerical solution
------------------------------------

After having seen the phase error grow with time in the previous
section, we shall now quantify this error through mathematical analysis.  The
key tool in the analysis will be to establish an exact solution of the
discrete equations.  The difference equation :eq:`vib:ode1:step4`
has constant coefficients and is homogeneous. The solution is then of
the form :math:`u^n=A^n`, where :math:`A` is some number to be determined. Since
we have oscillating functions as solutions, the algebra will be
considerably simplified if we write :math:`A=\exp{(i\tilde\omega \Delta t)}`,
which means

.. math::
        
        A^n = \exp{(\tilde\omega \Delta t\, n)}=\exp{(\tilde\omega t)} =
        \cos (\tilde\omega t) + i\sin(\tilde \omega t)
        \thinspace .
        

The physically relevant numerical solution can
be taken as the real part of this complex expression.
With the rewrite :math:`A=\exp{(i\tilde\omega\Delta t)}`, the numerical frequency
:math:`\tilde\omega` is the quantity to determine.

Calculations now give

.. math::
        
        [D_tD_t u]^n &= \frac{\exp{(i\tilde\omega(t+\Delta t))} - 2\exp{(i\tilde\omega t)} + \exp{(i\tilde\omega(t-\Delta t))}}{\Delta t^2}\\
        &= \exp{(i\tilde\omega t)}\frac{1}{\Delta t^2}\left(\exp{(i\tilde\omega(\Delta t))} + \exp{(i\tilde\omega(-\Delta t))} - 2\right)\\
        &= \exp{(i\tilde\omega t)}\frac{2}{\Delta t^2}\left(\cosh(i\tilde\omega\Delta t) -1 \right)\\
        &= \exp{(i\tilde\omega t)}\frac{2}{\Delta t^2}\left(\cos(\tilde\omega\Delta t) -1 \right)\\
        &= -\exp{(i\tilde\omega t)}\frac{4}{\Delta t^2}\sin^2(\frac{\tilde\omega\Delta t}{2})
        

The last line follows from the relation
:math:`\cos x - 1 = -2\sin^2(x/2)` (try ``cos(x)-1`` in
`wolframalpha.com <http://www.wolframalpha.com>`_ to see the formula).
The scheme :eq:`vib:ode1:step4`
with :math:`u^n=\exp{(i\omega\tilde\Delta t\, n)}` inserted gives


.. math::
        
        -\exp{(i\tilde\omega t)}\frac{4}{\Delta t^2}\sin^2(\frac{\tilde\omega\Delta t}{2})
        + \omega^2 \exp{(i\tilde\omega t)} = 0,
        

which after dividing by :math:`\exp{(i\tilde\omega t)}` results in

.. math::
        
        \frac{4}{\Delta t^2}\sin^2(\frac{\tilde\omega\Delta t}{2}) = \omega^2
        \thinspace .
        

The first step in solving for the unknown :math:`\tilde\omega` is

.. math::
         \sin^2(\frac{\tilde\omega\Delta t}{2}) = \left(\frac{\omega\Delta t}{2}\right)^2
        \thinspace .
        

Then, taking the square root, applying the inverse sine function, and
multiplying by :math:`2/\Delta t`, results in

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode1:tildeomega
        
        \tilde\omega = \pm \frac{2}{\Delta t}\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega\Delta t}{2}\right)
        \thinspace .
        
        


The first observation of :eq:`vib:ode1:tildeomega` tells that
there is a phase error since the numerical frequency :math:`\tilde\omega`
never equals the exact frequency :math:`\omega`. But how good is
the approximation :eq:`vib:ode1:tildeomega`? Taylor series expansion
for small :math:`\Delta t` may give an expression that is easier to understand:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> from sympy import *
        >>> dt, w = symbols('dt w')
        >>> w_tilde = asin(w*dt/2).series(dt, 0, 4)*2/dt
        >>> print w_tilde
        (dt*w + dt**3*w**3/24 + O(dt**4))/dt

This means that

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode1:tildeomega:series
        
        \tilde\omega = \omega\left( 1 + \frac{1}{24}\omega^2\Delta t^2\right) + {\cal O}(\Delta t^3)
        \thinspace .
        
        

That is, the error in the numerical frequency is of second-order in
:math:`\Delta t`.
We see that :math:`\tilde\omega > \omega` since the term :math:`\omega^3\Delta t^2/24 >0`
and this is by far the biggest term in the series expansion for small
:math:`\omega\Delta t`. A numerical frequency that is too large gives an oscillating
curve that oscillates too fast and therefore "lags behind" the exact
oscillations, a feature that can be seen in the plots.

Figure :ref:`vib:ode1:tildeomega:plot` plots the discrete frequency
:eq:`vib:ode1:tildeomega`
and its approximation :eq:`vib:ode1:tildeomega:series` for :math:`w=1`, based
on the program `vb_plot_freq.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/vib/vb_plot_freq.py>`_).
Although :math:`\tilde\omega` is a function of :math:`\Delta t` in
ref:eq:`vib:ode1:tildeomega:series`,
it is instructive to replace :math:`\Delta t` by the number of time steps
per period in the solution, because :math:`\omega\Delta t` is the key
parameter in the problem and this parameter reflects how many time
steps we have per period. The plot shows
that at least 25-30 points per period are necessary for reasonable
accuracy, but this depends on the length of the simulation (:math:`T`) as
the total phase error due to the frequency error grows linearly with time
(see :ref:`vib:exer:phase:err:growth`).


.. _vib:ode1:tildeomega:plot:

.. figure:: fig-vib/discrete_freq.png
   :width: 400

   *Exact discrete frequency and its second-order series expansion*



Exact discrete solution
-----------------------

More important than the :math:`\tilde\omega = w + {\cal O}(\Delta t^2)`
result is the fact that we have an exact discrete solution of
the problem:

.. math::
   :label: vib:ode1:un:exact
        
        u^n = I\cos\left(\tilde\omega n\Delta t\right),\quad
        \tilde\omega = \frac{2}{\Delta t}\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega\Delta t}{2}\right)
        \thinspace .
        
        

Such an exact discrete solution is ideal for verification purposes
(and you are encouraged to make a test based on :eq:`vib:ode1:un:exact`
in :ref:`vib:exer:nosetests`).

Stability
---------

Looking at :eq:`vib:ode1:un:exact`, it appears that the numerical
solution has constant and correct amplitude, but an error in the
frequency (phase error). However, a constant amplitude demands
that :math:`\tilde\omega` is a real number. A complex :math:`\tilde\omega` is
indeed possible if the argument :math:`x` of :math:`\sin^{-1}(x)` has magnitude
larger than unity: :math:`|x|>1` (type ``asin(x)`` in `wolframalpha.com <http://www.wolframalpha.com>`_ to see basic properties of :math:`\sin^{-1} (x)`).
A complex :math:`\tilde\omega` can be written :math:`\tilde\omega = \tilde\omega_r +
i\tilde\omega_i`. Since :math:`\sin^{-1}(x)` has a *negative* imaginary part for
:math:`x>1`, it means that
:math:`\exp{(i\omega\tilde t)}=\exp{(-\tilde\omega_i t)}\exp{(i\tilde\omega_r t)}`
will lead to exponential growth in time because :math:`\tilde\omega_i <0` and hence
:math:`-\tilde\omega_i t > 0`.


.. index:: stability criterion


We do not tolerate growth in the amplitude and we therefore
have a *stability criterion*

.. math::
        
        \frac{\omega\Delta t}{2} \leq 1\quad\Rightarrow\quad
        \Delta t \leq \frac{2}{\omega}
        \thinspace .
        

With :math:`\omega =2\pi`, :math:`\Delta t > \pi^{-1} = 0.3183098861837907` will give
growing solutions. Figure :ref:`vib:ode1:dt:unstable`
displays what happens when :math:`\Delta t =0.3184`,
which is slightly above the critical value: :math:`\Delta t =\pi^{-1} + 9.01\cdot
10^{-5}`.


.. _vib:ode1:dt:unstable:

.. figure:: fig-vib/vib_unstable.png
   :width: 400

   *Growing, unstable solution because of a time step slightly beyond the stability limit*


From the analysis we can draw three important conclusions:

1. The key parameter in the formulas is :math:`p=\omega\Delta t`.
   The period of oscillations is :math:`P=2\pi/\omega`, and the
   number of time steps per period is :math:`N_P=P/\Delta t`.
   Therefore, :math:`p=\omega\Delta t = 2\pi N_P`, showing that the
   critical parameter is the number of time steps per period.
   The smallest possible :math:`N_P` is 2, showing that :math:`p\in (0,\pi]`.

2. Provided :math:`p\leq 2`, the amplitude if the numerical solution is
   constant.

3. The numerical solution exhibits a relative phase error
   :math:`\tilde\omega/\omega \approx 1 + \frac{1}{24}p^2`.
   This error leads to wrongly displaced peaks of the numerical
   solution, and the error in peak location grows linearly with time.

.. _vib:model2:

Alternative schemes based on 1st-order equations
================================================

A standard technique for solving second-order ODEs is
to rewrite them as a system of first-order ODEs and then apply the
vast collection of methods for first-order ODE systems.
Given the second-order ODE problem

.. math::
         u'' + \omega^2 u = 0,\quad u(0)=I,\ u'(0)=0,

we introduce the auxiliary variable :math:`v=u'` and express the ODE problem
in terms of first-order derivatives of :math:`u` and :math:`v`:


.. math::
        
        u' &= v,
        \\
        v' &= -\omega^2 u
        
        \thinspace .
        

The initial conditions become :math:`u(0)=I` and :math:`v(0)=0`.

Standard methods for 1st-order ODE systems
------------------------------------------

The Forward Euler scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Forward Euler approximation to our :math:`2\times 2` system of ODEs
(:ref:`vib:model2:ueq`)-(:ref:`vib:model2:veq`)
becomes


.. math::
        
        \lbrack D_t^+ u = v\rbrack^n,
        \lbrack D_t^+ v = -\omega^2 u\rbrack^n,
        

or written out,


.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} &= u^n + \Delta t v^n,\\
        v^{n+1} &= v^n -\Delta t \omega^2 u^n
        \thinspace .
        


The Backward Euler scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Backward Euler approximation the ODE system is equally easy to
write up in the operator notation:


.. math::
        
        \lbrack D_t^- u &= v\rbrack^{n+1},\\
        \lbrack D_t^- v &= -\omega u\rbrack^{n+1} \thinspace .
        

This becomes a coupled system for :math:`u^{n+1}` and :math:`v^{n+1}`:


.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} - \Delta t v^{n+1} &= u^{n},\\
        v^{n+1} + \Delta t \omega^2 u^{n+1} &= v^{n}
        \thinspace .
        


The Crank-Nicolson scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Crank-Nicolson scheme takes this form in the operator notation:


.. math::
        
        \lbrack D_t u &= \overline{v}^t\rbrack^{n+\frac{1}{2}},\\
        \lbrack D_t v &= -\omega \overline{u}^t\rbrack^{n+\frac{1}{2}}
        \thinspace .
        

Also a coupled system:


.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} - \frac{1}{2}\Delta t v^{n+1} &= u^{n} + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t v^{n},\\
        v^{n+1} + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t \omega^2 u^{n+1} &= v^{n}
        - \frac{1}{2}\Delta t \omega^2 u^{n}
        \thinspace .
        


Comparison of schemes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can easily compare methods like the ones above with the aid of the
`Odespy <https://github.com/hplgit/odespy>`_ package:


.. code-block:: python

        import odespy
        import numpy as np
        
        def f(u, t, w=1):
            # u is array of length 2 holding our [u, v]
            u, v = u
            return [v, -w**2*u]
        
        def run_solvers_and_plot(solvers, timesteps_per_period=20,
                                 num_periods=1, I=1, w=2*np.pi):
            P = 2*np.pi/w  # one period
            dt = P/timesteps_per_period
            N = num_periods*timesteps_per_period
            T = N*dt
            t_mesh = np.linspace(0, T, N+1)
        
            legends = []
            for solver in solvers:
                solver.set(f_kwargs={'w': w})
                solver.set_initial_condition([I, 0])
                u, t = solver.solve(t_mesh)

There is quite some more code dealing with plots also, and we refer
to the source file `vb_odespy.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/vib/vb_odespy.py>`_
for details. Observe that keyword arguments in ``f(u,t,w=1)`` can
be supplied through a solver parameter ``f_kwargs`` (dictionary).

Specification of the Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and
Crank-Nicolson schemes is done like this (the equivalent to
Crank-Nicolson in Odespy is ``MidpointImplicit``):


.. code-block:: python

        solvers = [
            odespy.ForwardEuler(f),
            # Implicit methods must use Newton solver to converge
            odespy.BackwardEuler   (f, nonlinear_solver='Newton'),
            odespy.MidpointImplicit(f, nonlinear_solver='Newton'),
            ]


The `vb_odespy.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/vib/vb_odespy.py>`_
program makes two plots of the computed solutions with the various
methods in the ``solvers`` list: one plot with :math:`u(t)` versus :math:`t`, and
one *phase plane plot* where :math:`v` is plotted against :math:`u`.
That is, the phase plane plot is the curve :math:`(u(t),v(t))` parameterized
by :math:`t`. Analytically, :math:`u=I\cos(\omega t)` and :math:`v=u'=-\omega I\sin(\omega t)`.
The exact curve :math:`(u(t),v(t))` is therefore an ellipse, which often
looks like a circle in a plot because the axes are automatically scaled. The
important feature, however, is that exact curve :math:`(u(t),v(t))` is
closed and repeats itself for every period. Not all numerical schemes
are capable to do that.

The Forward Euler scheme in Figure
:ref:`vib:ode1:1st:odespy:theta:phaseplane` has a pronounced spiral
curve, pointing to the fact that the amplitude steadily grows, which
is also evident in Figure :ref:`vib:ode1:1st:odespy:theta`.
The Backward Euler scheme has a similar feature, except that the
spriral goes inward and the amplitude is significantly damped.  The
changing amplitude and the sprial form decreases with decreasing time
step.  The Crank-Nicolson scheme (MidpointImplicit) looks much more
accurate.  In fact, these plots tell that the Forward and Backward
Euler schemes are not suitable for solving our ODEs with oscillating
solutions.

We may run two popular standard methods for first-order ODEs, the 2nd-
and 4th-order Runge-Kutta methods, to see how they perform. Figures
:ref:`vib:ode1:1st:odespy:RK:phaseplane` and
:ref:`vib:ode1:1st:odespy:RK` show the solutions with larger :math:`\Delta
t` values than what was used in the previous two plots.  How the
amplitude develops in longer time integrations is illustrated in
Figures :ref:`vib:ode1:1st:odespy:RK:long:phaseplane` and
:ref:`vib:ode1:1st:odespy:RK:long`. The markers are dropped in these
plots because there are so many mesh points with markers when :math:`T`
corresponds to 10 periods.  The visual impression is that the
4th-order Runge-Kutta method is very accurate, under all circumstances
in these tests, and the 2nd-order scheme suffer from amplitude errors
unless the time step is very small.

The corresponding results for the Crank-Nicolson scheme
are shown in Figures :ref:`vib:ode1:1st:odespy:CN:long:phaseplane` and
:ref:`vib:ode1:1st:odespy:CN:long`. It is clear that scheme outperforms
the 2nd-order Runge-Kutta method. Both schemes has the same order
of accuracy, but their differences in accuracy is clearly pronounced
in this example.

.. _vib:model2:EulerCromer:

The Euler-Cromer method
-----------------------

While the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method and the a centered Crank-Nicolson scheme
work well for the first-order formulation of the vibration model, both
were inferior to the straightforward scheme for the second-order
equation :math:`u''+\omega^2u=0`. However, there is a similarly successful
scheme available for the first-order system :math:`u'=v`, :math:`v'=-\omega^2u`,
to be presented next.

Forward-backward discretization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The idea is to apply a Forward Euler discretization to the first
equation and a Backward Euler discretization to the second. In operator
notation this is stated as


.. math::
        
        \lbrack D_t^+u &= v\rbrack^n,\\
        \lbrack D_t^-v &= -\omega u\rbrack^{n+1}
        \thinspace .
        

We can write out the formulas and collect the unknowns on the left-hand side:

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} &= u^n + \Delta t v^n,
        \\
        v^{n+1} &= v^n -\Delta t \omega^2u^{n+1}
        
        \thinspace .
        

We realize that :math:`u^{n+1}` can be computed from
(:ref:`vib:model2:EulerCromer:ueq1`) and then :math:`v^{n+1}` from
(:ref:`vib:model2:EulerCromer:veq1`) using the recently computed value
:math:`u^{n+1}` on the right-hand side.

.. Despite using a backward difference, there is no need to solve a coupled

.. system for :math:`u^{n+1}` and :math:`v^{n+1}` because the structure of the ODEs

.. allows (:ref:`vib:model2:EulerCromer:ueq1`)


The scheme
(:ref:`vib:model2:EulerCromer:ueq1`)-(:ref:`vib:model2:EulerCromer:veq1`)
goes under several names: Forward-backward scheme, `Semi-implicit Euler method <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-implicit_Euler_method>`_, symplectic
Euler, semi-explicit Euler, Newton-Stormer-Verlet, and Euler-Cromer.
Since both discretizations are based on first-order difference
approximation, one may think that the scheme is only of first-order,
but this is not true: the use of a forward and then a backward
difference make errors cancel so that the overall error in the scheme
os :math:`{\cal O}(\Delta t^2)`. This is explaned below.

Equivalence with the scheme for the second-order ODE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We may eliminate the :math:`v^n` variable from
(:ref:`vib:model2:EulerCromer:ueq1`)-(:ref:`vib:model2:EulerCromer:veq1`).
From (:ref:`vib:model2:EulerCromer:veq1`) we have
:math:`v^n = v^{n-1} - \Delta t \omega^2u^{n}`, which can be inserted
in (:ref:`vib:model2:EulerCromer:ueq1`) to yield

.. math::
   :label: vib:model2:EulerCromer:elim1
        
        u^{n+1} = u^n + \Delta t v^{n-1} - \Delta t^2 \omega^2u^{n} .
        
        

The :math:`v^{n-1}` quantity can be expressed by :math:`u^n` and :math:`u^{n-1}`
using (:ref:`vib:model2:EulerCromer:ueq1`):

.. math::
         v^{n-1} = \frac{u^n - u^{n-1}}{\Delta t},
        

and when this is inserted in :eq:`vib:model2:EulerCromer:elim1` we get

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} = 2u^n - u^{n-1} - \Delta t^2 \omega^2u^{n},
        

which is nothing but the centered scheme :eq:`vib:ode1:step4`!
The previous analysis of this scheme then also applies to the Euler-Cromer
method.

The initial condition :math:`u'=0` means :math:`u'=v=0`. Then :math:`v^0=0`, and
(:ref:`vib:model2:EulerCromer:ueq1`) implies :math:`u^1=u^0`, while
(:ref:`vib:model2:EulerCromer:veq1`) says :math:`v^1=-\omega^2 u^0`.
This approximation, :math:`u^1=u^0`,
corresponds to a first-order Forward Euler discretization
of the initial condition :math:`u'(0)=0`: :math:`[D_t^+ u = 0]^0`.
