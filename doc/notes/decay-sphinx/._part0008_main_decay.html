<p>This section presents many mathematical models that all
end up with ODEs of the type <span class="math">\(u'=-au+b\)</span>.
The applications are taken from biology,
finance, and physics, and cover population growth or decay, compound
interest and inflation, radioactive decay, cooling of objects,
compaction of geological media, pressure
variations in the atmosphere, and air resistance on falling or rising
bodies.</p>
<div class="section" id="scaling-1">
<span id="decay-app-scaling"></span><h2>Scaling  (1)<a class="headerlink" href="#scaling-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Real applications of a model <span class="math">\(u'=-au+b\)</span> will often involve a lot
of parameters in the expressions for <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. It can be quite
a challenge to find relevant values of all parameters. In simple
problems, however, it turns out that it is not always necessary
to estimate all parameters because we can lump them into one or
a few <em>dimensionless</em> numbers by using a very attractive technique
called scaling. It simply means to stretch the <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t\)</span> axis
is the present problem - and suddenly all parameters in the problem
are lumped one parameter if <span class="math">\(b\neq 0\)</span> and no parameter when <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span>!</p>
<p>Scaling means that we introduce a new function <span class="math">\(\bar u(\bar t)\)</span>,
with</p>
<div class="math">
\[\bar u = \frac{u - u_m}{u_c},\quad \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(u_m\)</span> is a characteristic value of <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u_c\)</span> is a characteristic
size of the range of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> values, and <span class="math">\(t_c\)</span> is a characteristic
size of the range of <span class="math">\(t_c\)</span> where <span class="math">\(u\)</span> varies significantly.
Choosing <span class="math">\(u_m\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u_c\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(t_c\)</span> is not always easy and often an art
in complicated problems. We just state one choice first:</p>
<div class="math">
\[u_c = I,\quad u_m = b/a,\quad t_c = 1/a{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Inserting <span class="math">\(u=u_m + u_c\bar u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t=t_c\bar t\)</span> in the problem
<span class="math">\(u'=-au + b\)</span>, assuming <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are constants, results after some
algebra in the <em>scaled problem</em></p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t} = -\bar u,\quad \bar u(0)=1 - \beta,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> is a dimensionless number</p>
<div class="math">
\[\beta = \frac{b}{Ia}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>That is, only the special combination of <span class="math">\(b/(Ia)\)</span> matters, not what
the individual values of <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(I\)</span> are. Moreover, if <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span>,
the scaled problem is independent of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(I\)</span>! In practice this means
that we can perform one numerical simulation of the scaled problem and
recover the solution of any problem for a given <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(I\)</span> by
stretching the axis in the plot: <span class="math">\(u=I\bar u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t =\bar t/a\)</span>.
For <span class="math">\(b\neq 0\)</span>, we simulate the scaled problem for a few <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> values
and recover the physical solution <span class="math">\(u\)</span> by translating and stretching the <span class="math">\(u\)</span>
axis and stretching the <span class="math">\(t\)</span> axis.</p>
<p>The scaling breaks down if <span class="math">\(I=0\)</span>. In that case we may choose <span class="math">\(u_m=0\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(u_c=b/a\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(t_c=1/b\)</span>, resulting in a slightly different scaled problem:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t} = 1 -\bar u,\quad \bar u(0)=0{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>As with <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span>, the case <span class="math">\(I=0\)</span> has a scaled problem with no physical
parameters!</p>
<p>It is common to drop the bars after scaling and write the scaled
problem as <span class="math">\(u'=-u\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u(0)=1-\beta\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(u'=1-u\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u(0)=0\)</span>.
Any implementation of the problem <span class="math">\(u'=-au+b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u(0)=I\)</span>, can be
reused for the scaled problem by setting <span class="math">\(a=1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(I=1-\beta\)</span>
in the code, if <span class="math">\(I\neq 0\)</span>, or one sets
<span class="math">\(a=1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b=1\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(I=0\)</span> when the physical <span class="math">\(I\)</span> is zero.
Falling bodies in fluids, as described in the section <a class="reference internal" href="main_decay.html#decay-app-drag"><em>Vertical motion of a body in a viscous fluid</em></a>,
involves <span class="math">\(u'=-au+b\)</span> with seven physical parameters. All these vanish
in the scaled version of the problem if we start the motion from rest!</p>

<div class="section" id="evolution-of-a-population">
<span id="decay-app-pop"></span><h2>Evolution of a population<a class="headerlink" href="#evolution-of-a-population" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-0">Let <span class="math">\(N\)</span> be the number of individuals in a population occupying some
spatial domain.
Despite <span class="math">\(N\)</span> being an integer in this problem,
we shall compute with <span class="math">\(N\)</span> as a real number
and view <span class="math">\(N(t)\)</span> as a continuous function of time.
The basic model assumption is that in a time interval <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> the number of
newcomers to the populations (newborns) is proportional to
<span class="math">\(N\)</span>, with proportionality constant <span class="math">\(\bar b\)</span>. The amount of
newcomers will increase the population and result in
to</p>
<div class="math">
\[N(t+\Delta t) = N(t) + \bar bN(t)\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>It is obvious that a long time interval <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> will result in
more newcomers and hence a larger <span class="math">\(\bar b\)</span>. Therefore, we introduce
<span class="math">\(b=\bar b/\Delta t\)</span>: the number of newcomers per unit time and per
individual. We must then multiply <span class="math">\(b\)</span> by the length of the time
interval considered and by the population size to get the
total number of new individuals, <span class="math">\(b\Delta t N\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the number of removals from the population (deaths) is also
proportional to <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, with proportionality constant <span class="math">\(d\Delta t\)</span>,
the population evolves according to</p>
<div class="math">
\[N(t+\Delta t) = N(t) + b\Delta t N(t) - d\Delta t N(t)\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Dividing by <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> and letting <span class="math">\(\Delta t \rightarrow 0\)</span>,
we get the ODE</p>
<div class="math">
\[N' = (b-d)N,\quad N(0)=N_0\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>In a population where the death rate (<span class="math">\(d\)</span>) is larger than
then newborn rate (<span class="math">\(b\)</span>), <span class="math">\(a&gt;0\)</span>, and the population experiences
exponential decay rather than exponential growth.</p>
<p>In some populations there is an immigration of individuals into the
spatial domain. With <span class="math">\(I\)</span> individuals coming in per time unit,
the equation for the population change becomes</p>
<div class="math">
\[N(t+\Delta t) = N(t) + b\Delta t N(t) - d\Delta t N(t) + \Delta t I\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>The corresponding ODE reads</p>
<div class="math">
\[N' = (b-d)N + I,\quad N(0)=N_0
\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Some simplification arises if we introduce a fractional measure
of the population: <span class="math">\(u=N/N_0\)</span> and set <span class="math">\(r=b-d\)</span>. The ODE problem
now becomes</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:app:pop:ueq">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[     u' = ru + f,\quad u(0)=1,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(f=I/N_0\)</span> measures the net immigration per time unit as
the fraction of the initial population. Very often, <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is approximately
constant, but <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is usually a function of time.</p>
<p id="index-1">The growth rate <span class="math">\(r\)</span> of a population decreases if the environment
has limited resources. Suppose the environment can sustain at
most <span class="math">\(N_{\max}\)</span> individuals. We may then assume that the growth rate
approaches zero as <span class="math">\(N\)</span> approaches <span class="math">\(N_{\max}\)</span>, i.e., as <span class="math">\(u\)</span> approaches
<span class="math">\(M=N_{\max}/N_0\)</span>. The simplest possible evolution of <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is then a
linear function: <span class="math">\(r(t)=r_0(1-u(t)/M)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(r_0\)</span>
is the initial growth rate when the population is small relative to the
maximum size and there is enough resources. Using this <span class="math">\(r(t)\)</span> in
<a href="#equation-decay:app:pop:ueq">(1)</a> results in the <em>logistic model</em> for the
evolution of a population (assuming for the moment that <span class="math">\(f=0\)</span>):</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:app:pop:logistic">
<span class="eqno">(2)</span>\[     u' = r_0(1-u/M)u,\quad u(0)=1

<p>Initially, <span class="math">\(u\)</span> will grow at rate <span class="math">\(r_0\)</span>, but the growth will decay
as <span class="math">\(u\)</span> approaches <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, and then there is no more change in <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, causing
<span class="math">\(u\rightarrow M\)</span> as <span class="math">\(t\rightarrow\infty\)</span>.
Note that the logistic equation <span class="math">\(u'=r_0(1-u/M)u\)</span> is <em>nonlinear</em> because
of the quadratic term <span class="math">\(-u^2r_0/M\)</span>.</p>

<span id="decay-app-interest"></span><h2>Compound interest and inflation<a class="headerlink" href="#compound-interest-and-inflation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Say the annual interest rate is <span class="math">\(r\)</span> percent and that the bank
adds the interest once a year to your investment.
If <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> is the investment in year <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, the investment in year <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}\)</span>
grows to</p>
<div class="math">
\[u^{n+1} = u^n + \frac{r}{100}u^n
\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>In reality, the interest rate is added every day. We therefore introduce
a parameter <span class="math">\(m\)</span> for the number of periods per year when the interest
is added. If <span class="math">\(n\)</span> counts the periods, we have the fundamental model
for compound interest:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:app:interest:eq1">
<span class="eqno">(3)</span>\[     u^{n+1} = u^n + \frac{r}{100 m}u^n
     \thinspace .\]</div>
<p>This model is a <em>difference equation</em>, but it can be transformed to a
continuous differential equation through a limit process.
The first step is to derive a formula for the growth of the investment
over a time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.
Starting with an investment <span class="math">\(u^0\)</span>, and assuming that <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is constant in time,
we get</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}u^{n+1} &amp;= \left(1 + \frac{r}{100 m}\right)u^{n}\\
&amp;= \left(1 + \frac{r}{100 m}\right)^2u^{n-1}\\
&amp;\ \ \vdots\\
&amp;= \left(1 +\frac{r}{100 m}\right)^{n+1}u^{0}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Introducing time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, which here is a real-numbered counter for years,
we have that <span class="math">\(n=mt\)</span>, so we can write</p>
<div class="math">
\[u^{mt} = \left(1 + \frac{r}{100 m}\right)^{mt} u^0\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>The second step is to assume <em>continuous compounding</em>, meaning that the
interest is added continuously. This implies <span class="math">\(m\rightarrow\infty\)</span>, and
in the limit one gets the formula</p>
<div class="math">
\[u(t) = u_0e^{rt/100},\]</div>
<p>which is nothing but the solution of the ODE problem</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:app:interest:eq2">
<span class="eqno">(4)</span>\[     u' = \frac{r}{100}u,\quad u(0)=u_0
     \thinspace .\]</div>
<p>This is then taken as the ODE model for compound interest if <span class="math">\(r&gt;0\)</span>.
However, the reasoning applies equally well to inflation, which is
just the case <span class="math">\(r&lt;0\)</span>. One may also take the <span class="math">\(r\)</span> in <a href="#equation-decay:app:interest:eq2">(4)</a>
as the net growth of an investemt, where <span class="math">\(r\)</span> takes both compound interest
and inflation into account. Note that for real applications we must
use a time-dependent <span class="math">\(r\)</span> in <a href="#equation-decay:app:interest:eq2">(4)</a>.</p>
<p>Introducing <span class="math">\(a=\frac{r}{100}\)</span>, continuous inflation of an initial
fortune <span class="math">\(I\)</span> is then

<p>An atomic nucleus of an unstable atom may lose energy by emitting
ionizing particles and thereby be transformed to a nucleus with a
different number of protons and neutrons.  This process is known as
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay">radioactive decay</a>.
Actually, the process is stochastic when viewed for a single atom,
because it is impossible to predict exactly when a particular atom
emits a particle. Nevertheless, with a large number of atoms, <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, one
may view the process as deterministic and compute the mean behavior of
the decay. Below we reason intuitively about an ODE for the mean

for single atoms leads the same mean behavior.</p>

<p>Suppose at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, the number of the original atom type is <span class="math">\(N(t)\)</span>.
A basic model assumption is that the transformation of the atoms of the original

<p>The parameter <span class="math">\(a\)</span> can for a given nucleus be expressed through the

<h3>Stochastic model<a class="headerlink" href="#stochastic-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have originally <span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> atoms. Each atom may have decayed or
survived at a particular time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>. We want to count how many original
atoms that are left, i.e., how many atoms that have survived.
The survival of a single atom at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is a random event. Since there
are only two outcomes, survival or decay, we have a
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial">Bernoulli trial</a>.
Let <span class="math">\(p\)</span> be the
probability of survival (implying that the probability of decay
is <span class="math">\(1-p\)</span>). If each atom survives independently of
the others, and the probability of survival is the same for every
atom, we have <span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> statistically Bernoulli trials, known as
a <em>binomial experiment</em> from probability theory.
The probability <span class="math">\(P(N)\)</span> that <span class="math">\(N\)</span> out
of the <span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> atoms have survived at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is then given by the

<p>It remains to estimate <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. Let the interval <span class="math">\([0,t]\)</span> be divided into <span class="math">\(m\)</span>
small subintervals of length <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>. We make the assumption that
the probability of decay of a single atom in an interval of length <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>
is <span class="math">\(\tilde p\)</span>, and that this probability is proportional to <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>:
<span class="math">\(\tilde p = \lambda\Delta t\)</span> (it sounds natural that the probability
of decay increases with <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>). The corresponding probability of survival
is <span class="math">\(1-\lambda\Delta t\)</span>. Believing that <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> is independent
of time, we have, for each interval of length <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>,
a Bernoulli trial: the atom either survives or
decays in that interval. Now, <span class="math">\(p\)</span> should be the probability that the atom
survives in all the intervals, i.e., that we have <span class="math">\(m\)</span> successful
Bernoulli trials in a row and therefore</p>
<div class="math">
\[p = (1-\lambda\Delta t)^m{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The expected number of atoms of the original type at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is</p>
<div class="math">
\[{\hbox{E}\lbrack P \rbrack} = N_0p = N_0(1-\lambda\Delta t)^m,\quad m=t/\Delta t{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>To see the relation between the two types of Bernoulli trials and the
ODE above, we go to the limit <span class="math">\(\Delta t\rightarrow t\)</span>, <span class="math">\(m\rightarrow\infty\)</span>.
One can show that</p>
<div class="math">
\[p = \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} (1-\lambda\Delta t)^m
= \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} \left(1-\lambda\frac{t}{m}\right)^m = e^{-\lambda t}\]</div>
<p>This is the famous exponential waiting time (or arrival time) distribution for a
Poisson process in probability theory (obtained here, as often done, as
the limit of a binomial experiment). The probability of decay,
<span class="math">\(1-e^{-\lambda t}\)</span>, follows an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">exponential distribution</a>.
The limit means that <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is very
large, hence <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> is very small, and <span class="math">\(\tilde p=\lambda\Delta t\)</span>
is very small since the intensity of the events, <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>, is assumed
finite. This situation corresponds to a very small probability
that an atom will decay in a very short time interval, which is a
reasonable model.
The same model occurs in lots of different applications, e.g.,
when waiting for a taxi, or when finding defects along a rope.</p>

<span id="decay-app-newton-cooling"></span><h2>Newton&#8217;s law of cooling<a class="headerlink" href="#newton-s-law-of-cooling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When a body at some temperature is placed in a cooling environment,
experience shows that the temperature falls rapidly in the beginning,
and then the changes in temperature levels off until the body&#8217;s
temperature equals that of the surroundings. Newton carried out some
experiments on cooling hot iron and found that the temperature
evolved as a &#8220;geometric progression at times in arithmetic progression&#8221;,
meaning that the temperature decayed exponentially.
Later, this result was formulated as a differential equation:
the rate of change of the temperature in a body is proportional to
the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings.
This statement is known as <em>Newton&#8217;s law of cooling</em>, which
can be mathematically expressed as</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:Newton:cooling">
<span class="eqno">(5)</span>\[     {dT\over dt} = -k(T-T_s),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(T\)</span> is the temperature of the body, <span class="math">\(T_s\)</span> is the temperature
of the surroundings, <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is time, and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is a positive constant.
Equation <a href="#equation-decay:Newton:cooling">(5)</a> is primarily viewed as an
empirical law, valid when heat is efficiently convected away
from the surface of the body by a flowing fluid such as air
at constant temperature <span class="math">\(T_s\)</span>.
The <em>heat transfer coefficient</em> <span class="math">\(k\)</span> reflects the transfer of
heat from the body to
the surroundings and must be determined from physical experiments.</p>

three different types of forces: the gravity force, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)">the drag force</a>,
and the buoyancy force.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview-of-forces">
<h3>Overview of forces<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-forces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The gravity force is <span class="math">\(F_g= -mg\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is the mass of the body and
<span class="math">\(g\)</span> is the acceleration of gravity.
The uplift or buoyancy force (&#8220;Archimedes force&#8221;) is <span class="math">\(F_b = \varrho gV\)</span>,
where <span class="math">\(\varrho\)</span> is the density of the fluid and
<span class="math">\(V\)</span> is the volume of the body.
Forces and other quantities are taken as positive in the upward
direction.</p>
<p>The drag force is of two types, depending on the Reynolds number</p>
<div class="math">
\[\hbox{Re} = \frac{\varrho d|v|}{\mu},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is the diameter of the body in

body, and <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.
When <span class="math">\(\hbox{Re} &lt; 1\)</span>, the drag force is fairly well modeled by
the so-called Stokes&#8217; drag,
which for a spherical body of diameter <span class="math">\(d\)</span> reads</p>

<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}

<p>with boundary conditions <span class="math">\(u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0\)</span> and initial condition
<span class="math">\(u(x,0)=I(x)\)</span>. One may express the solution as</p>
<div class="math">
\[u(x,t) = \sum_{k=1}^m A_k(t)e^{ikx\pi/L},\]</div>
<p>for appropriate unknown functions <span class="math">\(A_k\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k=1,\ldots,m\)</span>.
We use the complex exponential <span class="math">\(e^{ikx\pi/L}\)</span> for easy algebra, but
the physical <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is taken as the real part of any complex expression.
Note that the expansion in terms of <span class="math">\(e^{ikx\pi/L}\)</span> is compatible with
the boundary conditions: all functions <span class="math">\(e^{ikx\pi/L}\)</span> vanish for
<span class="math">\(x=0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x=L\)</span>. Suppose we can express <span class="math">\(I(x)\)</span> as</p>
<div class="math">
\[I(x) = \sum_{k=1}^m I_ke^{ikx\pi/L}

<p>Such an expansion can be computed by well-known Fourier expansion techniques,
but the details are not important here.
Also, suppose we can express the given <span class="math">\(f(x,t)\)</span> as</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(x,t) = \sum_{k=1}^m b_k(t)e^{ikx\pi/L}

<p>Inserting the expansions for <span class="math">\(u\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(f\)</span> in the differential equations demands that all terms corresponding
to a given <span class="math">\(k\)</span> must be equal. The calculations results in the follow
system of ODEs:</p>
<div class="math">
\[A_k'(t) = -\alpha\frac{k^2\pi^2}{L^2} + b_k(t),\quad k=1,\ldots,m
\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>From the initial condition</p>
<div class="math">
\[u(x,0)=\sum_k A_k(0)e^{ikx\pi/L}=I(x)=\sum_k I_k e^{(ikx\pi/L)},\]</div>
<p>it follows that <span class="math">\(A_k(0)=I_k\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k=1,\ldots,m\)</span>. We then have <span class="math">\(m\)</span>
equations of the form <span class="math">\(A_k'=-a A_k +b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(A_k(0)=I_k\)</span>, for
appropriate definitions of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. These ODE problems
independent each other such that we can solve one problem
at a time. The outline technique is a quite common approach for solving
partial differential equations.</p>
<p><em>Remark.</em> Since <span class="math">\(a_k\)</span> depends on <span class="math">\(k\)</span> and the stability of
the Forward Euler scheme demands <span class="math">\(a_k\Delta t \leq 1\)</span>, we get that
<span class="math">\(\Delta t \leq \alpha^{-1}L^2\pi^{-2} k^{-2}\)</span>. Usually, quite large
<span class="math">\(k\)</span> values are needed to accurately represent the given functions
<span class="math">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and then <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> needs to be very small for these large
values of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.
Therefore, the Crank-Nicolson and Backward Euler schemes, which
allow larger <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> without any growth in the solutions, are
more popular choices when creating time-stepping algorithms for

apply the solver to a skydiver in free fall, and finally apply the
solver to a complete parachute jump.</p>
<p>All the pieces of software implemented in this project
should be realized as Python functions and/or classes and collected
in one module.</p>
<p><em>a)</em> Set up the differential equation problem that governs the velocity
of the motion.
The parachute jumper is subject to the gravity force and a quadratic
drag force. Assume constant density.
Add an extra source term be used for program verification.
Identify the input data to the problem.</p>
<p><em>b)</em> Make a Python module for computing the velocity of the motion.

<p>Construct verification tests for computations in simplified

skydiving (0-4000 m).
The drag coefficient for a man in upright position can be set to 1.2.
Start with a zero velocity.
A free fall typically has a terminating velocity of 45 m/s. (This value
can be used to tune other parameters.)
.. &#8212; end hint in exercise &#8212;</p>
<p><em>f)</em> The next task is to simulate
a parachute jumper during free fall and after the parachute opens.
At the time the parachute opens, the drag coefficient and the cross-sectional
area change dramatically.
Generalize the solver function to a new function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">solver_parachute</span></tt> where
the drag coefficient and the cross-sectional area have different
values before and after time <span class="math">\(t_p\)</span> when the parachute is released.</p>
<p>Use the program to simulate a jump from <span class="math">\(z=3000\)</span> m to the ground <span class="math">\(z=0\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Hint.</em> Following Meade and Struthers <a class="reference internal" href="main_decay.html#ref6">[Ref6]</a>, one can set the
cross-section area perpendicular to the motion to 44 <span class="math">\(\hbox{m}^2\)</span>
when the parachute is open. The drag coefficient for an open
parachute can be taken as 1.8, but tuned using the known value
of the typical terminating velocity reached before landing:
5.3 m/s. The parachute is released after 10 s.</p>

<p>The goal of this exercise is to compute the value of a fortune subject
to inflation and a random interest rate.
Suppose that the inflation is constant at <span class="math">\(i\)</span> percent per year and that the
annual interest rate, <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, changes randomly at each time step,
starting at some value <span class="math">\(p_0\)</span> at <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span>.
The random change is from a value <span class="math">\(p^n\)</span> at <span class="math">\(t=t_n\)</span> to
<span class="math">\(p_n +\Delta p\)</span> with probability 0.25 and <span class="math">\(p_n -\Delta p\)</span> with probability 0.25.
No change occurs with probability 0.5. There is also no change if
<span class="math">\(p^{n+1}\)</span> exceeds 15 or becomes below 1.
Use a time step of one month, <span class="math">\(p_0=i\)</span>, initial fortune scaled to 1,
and simulate 1000 scenarios of
length 20 years. Compute the mean evolution of one unit of money and the
corresponding
standard deviation. Plot the mean curve along with the mean plus one
standard deviation and the mean minus one standard deviation. This will
illustrate the uncertainty in the mean curve.</p>
<p><em>Hint 1.</em> The following code snippet computes <span class="math">\(p^{n+1}\)</span>:</p>

<p><em>Hint 2.</em> If <span class="math">\(u_i(t)\)</span> is the value of the fortune in experiment number <span class="math">\(i\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(i=0,\ldots,N-1\)</span>,
the mean evolution of the fortune is</p>
<div class="math">
\[\bar u(t)= \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} u_i(t),\]</div>
<p>and the standard deviation is</p>
<div class="math">
\[s(t) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\left(- (\bar u(t))^2 +
                \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (u_i(t))^2\right)}
\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Suppose <span class="math">\(u_i(t)\)</span> is stored in an array <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">u</span></tt>.
The mean and the standard deviation of the fortune
is most efficiently computed by
using two accumulation arrays, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sum_u</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sum_u2</span></tt>, and
performing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sum_u</span> <span class="pre">+=</span> <span class="pre">u</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sum_u2</span> <span class="pre">+=</span> <span class="pre">u**2</span></tt> after every experiment.
This technique avoids storing all the <span class="math">\(u_i(t)\)</span> time series for
computing the statistics.</p>
