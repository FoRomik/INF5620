Note: **PRELIMINARY VERSION** (expect typos!)








Finite difference methods for partial differential equations (PDEs)
employ a range of concepts and tools that can be introduced and
illustrated in the context of simple ordinary differential equation
(ODE) examples.  By first working with ODEs, we keep the mathematical
problems to be solved as simple as possible (but no simpler), thereby
allowing full focus on understanding the concepts and tools that will
be reused and further extended when addressing finite difference
methods for time-dependent PDEs. The
forthcoming treatment of ODEs is therefore solely dominated by
reasoning and methods that directly carry over to numerical
methods for PDEs.

We study two model problems: an ODE for a decaying phenomena, which will
be relevant for PDEs of diffusive nature, and an ODE for oscillating
phenomena, which will be relevant for PDEs of wave nature.
Both problems are linear with known analytical solutions such that we can
easily assess the quality of various numerical methods and analyze
their behavior.

Finite difference methods
=========================

The purpose of this module is to explain finite difference methods
in detail for a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Emphasis is put on the reasoning when discretizing the problem,
various ways of programming the methods, how to verify that
the implementation is correct, experimental investigations of
the numerical behavior of the methods, and theoretical analysis
of the methods to explain the observations.

.. _decay:model:

A basic model for exponential decay
-----------------------------------


.. index:: decay (problem)

.. index:: exponential decay


Our model problem is perhaps the simplest ODE:


.. math::
        
        u'(t) = -au(t),
        

Here, :math:`a>0` is a constant and :math:`u'(t)` means differentiation with respect
to time :math:`t`. This type of equation arises in a number of widely different
phenomena where some quantity :math:`u` undergoes exponential
reduction. Examples include radioactive decay, population decay,
investment decay,
cooling of an object,
pressure decay in the atmosphere,
and retarded motion in fluids (for some of these models, :math:`a` can be
negative as well).
Studying numerical solution methods for this simple ODE
gives important insight that can be reused for diffusion PDEs.

The analytical solution of the ODE is found by the method of
separation of variables, resulting in


.. math::
         u(t) = Ce^{-at},

for any arbitrary constant :math:`C`.
To formulate a mathematical problem for which there
is a unique solution, we need a condition to fix the value of :math:`C`.
This condition is known as the *initial condition* and stated as
:math:`u(0)=I`. That is, we know the
value :math:`I` of :math:`u` when the process starts at :math:`t=0`. The exact solution
is then :math:`u(t)=I\exp{(-at)}`.

We seek the solution :math:`u(t)` of the ODE for :math:`t\in (0,T]`. The point :math:`t=0` is not
included since we know :math:`u` here and assume that the equation governs
:math:`u` for :math:`t>0`. The complete ODE problem then reads: find :math:`u(t)`
such that


.. math::
   :label: decay:problem
        
        u' = -au,\ t\in (0,T], \quad u(0)=I\thinspace .  
        

This is known as a *continuous problem* because the parameter :math:`t`
varies continuously from :math:`0` to :math:`T`. For each :math:`t` we have a corresponding
:math:`u(t)`. There are hence infinitely many values of :math:`t` and :math:`u(t)`.
The purpose of a numerical method is to formulate a corresponding
*discrete* problem whose solution is characterized by a finite number of values,
which can be computed in a finite number of steps on a computer.



.. _decay:sec:FE:

The Forward Euler scheme
------------------------

Solving an ODE like :eq:`decay:problem` by a finite difference method
consists of the following four steps:

1. discretizing the domain,

2. fulfilling the equation at discrete time points,

3. replacing derivatives by finite differences,

4. formulating a recursive algorithm.

.. index::
   single: mesh; finite differences



Step 1: Discretizing the domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The time domain :math:`[0,T]` is represented by a finite number of
:math:`N+1` points


.. math::
        
        0 = t_0 < t_1 < t_2 < \cdots < t_{N-1} < t_N = T\thinspace .
        

The collection of points :math:`t_0,t_1,\ldots,t_N` constitutes a *mesh*
or *grid*. Often the mesh points will be uniformly spaced in
the domain :math:`[0,T]`, which means that the spacing :math:`t_{n+1}-t_n` is
the same for all :math:`n`. This spacing is then often denoted by :math:`\Delta t`,
in this case :math:`t_n=n\Delta t`.

We seek the solution :math:`u` at the mesh points:
:math:`u(t_n)`, :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N` (note that :math:`u^0` is already known as :math:`I`).
A notational short-form for :math:`u(t_n)`,
which will be used extensively, is :math:`u^{n}`. More precisely, we let
:math:`u^n` be the *numerical approximation* to the exact solution
at :math:`t=t_n`, :math:`u(t_n)`. When we need to clearly distinguish the numerical
and the exact solution, we often place a subscript e on the exact
solution, as in :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(t_n)`. Figure :ref:`decay:fdu:e` shows the
:math:`t_n` and :math:`u_n` points for :math:`n=0,1,\ldots,N=7` as well as :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}(t)`
as the dashed line.


.. _decay:fdu:e:

   *Time mesh with discrete solution values*


Since finite difference methods produce solutions at the mesh
points only, it is an open question what the solution is between
the mesh points. One can use methods for interpolation to
compute the value of :math:`u` between mesh points. The simplest
(and most widely used) interpolation method is to assume that
:math:`u` varies linearly between the mesh points, see
Figure :ref:`decay:fdu:ei`. Given :math:`u^{n}`
and :math:`u^{n+1}`, the value of :math:`u` at some :math:`t\in [t_{n}, t_{n+1}]`
is by linear interpolation


.. math::
        
        u(t) \approx u^n + \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{t_{n+1}-t_n}(t - t_n)\thinspace .
        



.. _decay:fdu:ei:

.. figure:: fig-decay/fdm_u_uei.png
   :width: 600

   *Linear interpolation between the discrete solution values (dashed curve is exact solution)*



Step 2: Fulfilling the equation at discrete time points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ODE is supposed to hold for all :math:`t\in (0,T]`, i.e., at an infinite
number of points. Now we relax that requirement and require that
the ODE is fulfilled at a finite set of discrete points in time.
The mesh points :math:`t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_N` are a natural choice of points.
The original ODE is then reduced to  the following :math:`N` equations:


.. math::
   :label: decay:step2
        
        u'(t_n) = -au(t_n),\quad n=1,\ldots,N\thinspace .
        
        


Step 3: Replacing derivatives by finite differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next and most essential step of the method is to replace the
derivative :math:`u'` by a finite difference approximation. Let us first
try a one-sided difference approximation (see Figure :ref:`decay:sketch:FE`),


.. math::
   :label: decay:FEdiff
        
        u'(t_n) \approx \frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n}\thinspace .
        
        

Inserting this approximation in :eq:`decay:step2` results in


.. math::
   :label: decay:step3
        
        \frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n} = -au^{n},\quad n=0,1,\ldots,N-1\thinspace .
        
        

This equation is the discrete counterpart to the original ODE problem
:eq:`decay:problem`, and often known as a *finite difference scheme*,
which yields a straightforward way to compute the solution at
the mesh points (:math:`u(t_n)`, :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N`) as shown next.


.. _decay:sketch:FE:

   :width: 600

   *Illustration of a forward difference*


Step 4: Formulating a recursive algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. index:: difference equation


.. index:: Forward Euler scheme


The final step is to identify the computational algorithm to be implemented
in a program. The key observation here is to realize that
:eq:`decay:step3` can be used to compute :math:`u^{n+1}` if :math:`u^n` is known.
Starting with :math:`n=0`, :math:`u^0` is known since :math:`u^0=u(0)=I`, and
:eq:`decay:step3` gives an equation for :math:`u^1`. Knowing :math:`u^1`,
:math:`u^2` can be found from :eq:`decay:step3`. In general, :math:`u^n`
in :eq:`decay:step3` can be assumed known, and then we can easily solve for
the unknown :math:`u^{n+1}`:


.. math::
   :label: decay:FE
        
        u^{n+1} = u^n - a(t_{n+1} -t_n)u^n\thinspace .
        
        

We shall refer to :eq:`decay:FE` as the Forward Euler (FE) scheme
for our model problem. From a mathematical point of view,
equations of the form :eq:`decay:FE` are known as
*difference equations* since they express how differences in
:math:`u`, like :math:`u^{n+1}-u^n`, evolve with :math:`n`.
The finite difference method can be viewed as a method for turning
a differential equation into a difference equation.

Computation with :eq:`decay:FE` is straightforward:


.. math::
        
        u_0 &= I,\\
        u_1 & = u^0 - a(t_{1} -t_0)u^0 = I(1-a(t_1-t_0)),\\
        u_2 & = u^1 - a(t_{2} -t_1)u^1 = I(1-a(t_1-t_0))(1 - a(t_2-t_1)),\\
        u^3 &= u^2 - a(t_{3} -t_2)u^2 = I(1-a(t_1-t_0))(1 - a(t_2-t_1))(1 - a(t_3-t_2)),
        

and so on until we reach :math:`u^N`.
In the case :math:`t_{n+1}-t_n` is a constant, denoted by :math:`\Delta t`,
we realize from the above calculations that


.. math::
        
        u_0 &= I,\\
        u_1 & = I(1-a\Delta t),\\
        u_2 & = I(1-a\Delta t)^2,\\
        u^3 &= I(1-a\Delta t)^3,\\
        &\vdots\\
        u^N &= I(1-a\Delta t)^N\thinspace .
        

This means that we have found a closed formula for :math:`u^n`, and there is
no need to let a computer generate the sequence :math:`u^1, u^2, u^3, \ldots`.
However, finding such a formula for :math:`u^n` is possible only for a few very
simple problems.

As the next sections will show, the scheme :eq:`decay:FE` is just one
out of many alternative finite difference (and other) schemes for
the model problem :eq:`decay:problem`.

.. _decay:sec:BE:

The Backward Euler scheme
-------------------------

There are many choices of difference approximations in step 3 of
the finite difference method as presented in the previous section.
Another alternative is


.. math::
   :label: decay:BEdiff
        
        u'(t_n) \approx \frac{u^{n}-u^{n-1}}{t_{n}-t_{n-1}}\thinspace .
        
        

Since this difference is based on going backward in time (:math:`t_{n-1}`)
for information, it is known as the Backward Euler difference.
Figure :ref:`decay:sketch:BE` explains the idea.


.. _decay:sketch:BE:

.. figure:: fig-decay/fd_backward.png
   :width: 600

   *Illustration of a backward difference*



.. index::
   single: backward scheme, 1-step


.. index:: Backward Euler scheme


Inserting :eq:`decay:BEdiff` in :eq:`decay:step2` yields
the Backward Euler (BE) scheme:


.. math::
   :label: decay:BE0
        
        \frac{u^{n}-u^{n-1}}{t_{n}-t_{n-1}} = -a u^n\thinspace .
        
        

We assume, as explained under step 4 in the section :ref:`decay:sec:FE`,
that we have computed :math:`u^0, u^1, \ldots, u^{n-1}` such that
:eq:`decay:BE0` can be used to compute :math:`u^n`.
For direct similarity with the Forward Euler scheme :eq:`decay:FE`
we replace :math:`n` by :math:`n+1` in :eq:`decay:BE0` and solve for the
unknown value :math:`u^{n+1}`:


.. math::
   :label: decay:BE
        
        u^{n+1} = \frac{1}{1+ a(t_{n+1}-t_n)} u^n\thinspace .
        
        


.. _decay:sec:CN:

The Crank-Nicolson scheme
-------------------------


.. index:: Crank-Nicolson scheme


The finite difference approximations used to derive the schemes
:eq:`decay:FE` and :eq:`decay:BE` are both one-sided differences,
known to be less accurate than central (or midpoint)
differences. We shall now construct
a central difference at :math:`t_{n+1/2}=\frac{1}{2} (t_n + t_{n+1})`, or
:math:`t_{n+1/2}=(n+\frac{1}{2})\Delta t` if the mesh spacing is uniform in time.
The approximation reads


.. math::
   :label: decay:CNdiff
        
        u'(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}) \approx \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{t_{n+1}-t_n}\thinspace .
        
        

Note that the fraction on the right-hand side is the same as for the
Forward Euler approximation :eq:`decay:FEdiff` and
the Backward Euler approximation :eq:`decay:BEdiff` (with
:math:`n` replaced by :math:`n+1`). The accuracy of this fraction as an approximation
to the derivative of :math:`u` depends on *where* we seek the derivative:
in the center of the interval :math:`[t_{n},t_{n+1}]` or at the end points.

With the formula :eq:`decay:CNdiff`, where :math:`u'` is evaluated at
:math:`t_{n+1/2}`, it is natural to demand the
ODE to be fulfilled at the time points between the mesh points:


.. math::
   :label: decay:step2m
        
        u'(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}) = -au(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}),\quad n=0,\ldots,N-1\thinspace .
        
        

Using :eq:`decay:CNdiff` in :eq:`decay:step2m` results in


.. math::
   :label: decay:CN0
        
        \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{t_{n+1}-t_n} = -au^{n+\frac{1}{2}},
        
        

where :math:`u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}` is a short form for :math:`u(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}})`.
The problem is that we aim to compute :math:`u^n` for integer :math:`n`, implying that
:math:`u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}` is not a quantity computed by our method. It must be
expressed by the quantities that we actually produce, i.e., :math:`u` at the
mesh points. One possibility is to approximate :math:`u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}`
as an average of the :math:`u` values at the neighboring mesh points:


.. math::
   :label: decay:uhalfavg
        
        u^{n+\frac{1}{2}} \approx \frac{1}{2} (u^n + u^{n+1})\thinspace .
        
        

Using :eq:`decay:uhalfavg` in :eq:`decay:CN0` results in


.. math::
   :label: decay:CN1
        
        \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{t_{n+1}-t_n} = -a\frac{1}{2} (u^n + u^{n+1})\thinspace .
        
        

Figure :ref:`decay:sketch:BE` sketches the geometric interpretation of
such a centered difference.


.. _decay:sketch:BE:

.. figure:: fig-decay/fd_centered.png
   :width: 600

   *Illustration of a centered difference*


We assume that :math:`u^n` is already computed so that :math:`u^{n+1}` is the
unknown, which we can solve for:


.. math::
   :label: decay:CN
        
        u^{n+1} = \frac{1-\frac{1}{2} a(t_{n+1}-t_n)}{1 + \frac{1}{2} a(t_{n+1}-t_n)}u^n\thinspace .
        
        

The finite difference scheme :eq:`decay:CN` is known as
the midpoint scheme or the Crank-Nicolson (CN) scheme. We shall use the latter
name.


.. _decay:sec:theta:

The unifying :math:`\theta`-rule
--------------------------------


.. index:: weighted average

.. index:: theta-rule


Let us reconsider the derivation of the Forward Euler, Backward Euler,
and Crank-Nicolson schemes. In all the mentioned schemes we replace :math:`u'` by the
fraction


.. math::
         \frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n},

and the difference between the methods lies in which point this
fraction approximates the derivative; i.e., in which point we
sample the ODE. So far this has been the
end points or the midpoint of :math:`[t_n,t_{n+1}]`. However, we may choose any point
:math:`\tilde t \in [t_n,t_{n+1}]`.
The difficulty
is that evaluating the right-hand side :math:`-au` at an arbitrary point
faces the same problem as in
the section :ref:`decay:sec:CN`: the point value must be expressed
by the discrete :math:`u` quantities that we compute by the scheme, i.e.,
:math:`u^n` and :math:`u^{n+1}`. Following the averaging idea from
the section :ref:`decay:sec:CN`,
the value of :math:`u` at an arbitrary point :math:`\tilde t` can be
calculated as a *weighted average*, which generalizes the arithmetic average
:math:`\frac{1}{2}u^n + \frac{1}{2}u^{n+1}`.
If we express :math:`\tilde t` as a weighted average

.. math::
         t_{n+\theta} = \theta t_{n+1} + (1-\theta) t_{n},

where :math:`\theta\in [0,1]` is the weighting factor, we can write


.. math::
   :label: decay:thetaavg
        
        u(\tilde t) = u(\theta t_{n+1} + (1-\theta) t_{n}) \approx
        \theta u^{n+1} + (1-\theta) u^{n}\thinspace .
        
        



.. index:: theta-rule


We can now let the ODE hold at the point
:math:`\tilde t\in [t_n,t_{n+1}]`, approximate :math:`u'` by the fraction
:math:`(u^{n+1}-u^{n})/(t_{n+1}-t_n)`, and approximate the right-hand
side :math:`-au` by the weighted average :eq:`decay:thetaavg`.
The result is


.. math::
   :label: decay:th0
        
        \frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n} = -a (\theta u^{n+1} + (1-\theta) u^{n})
        
        \thinspace .
        

This is a generalized scheme for our model problem:
:math:`\theta =0` gives the Forward Euler scheme, :math:`\theta =1` gives the
Backward Euler scheme, and :math:`\theta =1/2` gives the Crank-Nicolson
scheme. In addition, we may choose any other value of :math:`\theta` in :math:`[0,1]`.

As before, :math:`u^n` is considered known and :math:`u^{n+1}` unknown, so
we solve for the latter:


.. math::
   :label: decay:th
        
        u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a(t_{n+1}-t_n)}{1 + \theta a(t_{n+1}-t_n)}\thinspace .
        
        

This scheme is known as the :math:`\theta`-rule, or alternatively written as
the "theta-rule".


Constant time step
------------------

All schemes up to now have been formulated for a general non-uniform
mesh in time: :math:`t_0,t_1,\ldots,t_N`. Non-uniform meshes are highly relevant
since one can use many points in regions where :math:`u` varies rapidly, and
save points in regions where :math:`u` is slowly varying. This is the key idea
of *adaptive* methods where the spacing of the mesh points
are determined as the computations proceed.

However, a uniformly distributed set of mesh points is very common and
sufficient for many applications. It therefore makes sense to
present the finite difference schemes for a uniform point distribution
:math:`t_n=n\Delta t`, where :math:`\Delta t` is the constant spacing between
the mesh points, also referred to as the *time step*.
The resulting formulas look simpler and are perhaps more
well known:


.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} &= (1 - a\Delta t )u^n  \quad (\hbox{FE})
        \\
        u^{n+1} &= \frac{1}{1+ a\Delta t} u^n  \quad (\hbox{BE})
        \\
        u^{n+1} &= \frac{1-\frac{1}{2} a\Delta t}{1 + \frac{1}{2} a\Delta t} u^n \quad \quad (\hbox{CN})
        \\
        u^{n+1} &= \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n \quad (\theta-\hbox{rule})
        
        


Not surprisingly, we present alternative schemes
because they have different pros and cons, both for the simple ODE
in question (which can easily be solved as accurately as desired), and for
more advanced differential equation problems.

.. _decay:sec:fdop:

Compact operator notation for finite differences
------------------------------------------------


.. index:: finite difference operator notation

.. index::
   single: operator notation, finite differences


Finite difference formulas can be tedious to write and read,
especially for differential equations with many terms and many
derivatives. To save space and help the reader of the scheme to quickly
see the nature of the difference approximations, we introduce a
compact notation. A forward difference approximation is denoted
by the :math:`D_t^+` operator:


.. math::
   :label: fd:D:f
        
        [D_t^+u]^n = \frac{u^{n+1} - u^{n}}{\Delta t}
        \approx \frac{d}{dt} u(t_n) 
        \thinspace .
        

The notation consists of an operator that approximates
differentiation with respect to an independent variable, here :math:`t`.
The operator is built of the symbol :math:`D`, with the variable as subscript
and a superscript denoting the type of difference. The superscript :math:`{}^+`
indicates a forward difference.
We place square brackets around the operator and the function it operates
on and specify the mesh point, where the operator is acting, by
a superscript.

The corresponding operator notation for a centered difference and
a backward difference reads


.. math::
   :label: fd:D:c
        
        [D_tu]^n = \frac{u^{n+\frac{1}{2}} - u^{n-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Delta t}
        \approx \frac{d}{dt} u(t_n), 
        

and

.. math::
   :label: fd:D:b
        
        [D_t^-u]^n = \frac{u^{n} - u^{n-1}}{\Delta t}
        \approx \frac{d}{dt} u(t_n) 
        \thinspace .
        

Note that the superscript :math:`{}^-` denotes the backward
difference, while no superscript implies a central difference.

An averaging operator is also convenient to have:


.. math::
   :label: fd:mean:a
        
        [\overline{u}^{t}]^n = \frac{1}{2} (u^{n-\frac{1}{2}} + u^{n+\frac{1}{2}} )
        \approx u(t_n) 
        

The superscript :math:`t` indicates that the average is taken along the time
coordinate. The common average :math:`(u^n + u^{n+1})/2` can now be
expressed as :math:`[\overline{u}^{t}]^{n+1/2}`.


The Backward Euler finite difference approximation to :math:`u'=-au` can be written
as follows utilizing the compact notation:


.. math::
        
        [D_t^-u]^n = -au^n \thinspace .
        

In difference equations we often place the square brackets around
the whole equation, to indicate at which mesh point the equation applies,
since each term is supposed to be approximated at the same point:


.. math::
        
        [D_t^- u  = -au]^n \thinspace .
        

The Forward Euler scheme takes the form


.. math::
        
        [D_t^+ u  = -au]^n,
        

while the Crank-Nicolson scheme is written as


.. math::
   :label: fd:compact:ex:CN
        
        [D_t u = -a\overline{u}^t]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\thinspace .
        
        

Just apply :eq:`fd:D:c` and :eq:`fd:mean:a` and write out the
expressions to see that :eq:`fd:compact:ex:CN` is indeed the
Crank-Nicolson scheme.


The :math:`\theta`-rule can be specified by


.. math::
   :label: decay:fd1:op:theta
        
        [\bar D_t u = -a\overline{u}^{t,\theta}]^{n+\theta},
        
        

if we define a new time difference and a *weighted averaging operator*:


.. math::
        
        [\bar D_t u]^{n+\theta} = \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{t^{n+1}-t^n},
        
        
        
        [\overline{u}^{t,\theta}]^{n+\theta} = (1-\theta)u^{n} + \theta u^{n+1}
        \approx u(t_{n+\theta}),
        
        

where :math:`\theta\in [0,1]`. Note that for :math:`\theta =1/2` we recover
the standard centered difference and the standard arithmetic average.
The idea in :eq:`decay:fd1:op:theta` is to sample the equation at
:math:`t_{n+\theta}`, use a skew difference at that
point :math:`[\bar D_t u]^{n+\theta}`, and a shifted mean value.
An alternative notation is

.. math::
         [D_t u]^{n+1/2} = \theta [-au]^{n+1} + (1-\theta)[-au]^{n}\thinspace .


Looking at the various examples above and comparing them with the
underlying differential equations, we see immediately which difference
approximations that have been used and at which point they
apply. Therefore, the compact notation efficiently communicates the
reasoning behind turning a differential equation into a difference
equation.



.. _decay:impl1:

Implementation  (1)
===================

The purpose now is to make a computer program for solving

.. math::
        
        u'(t) = -au(t),\quad t\in (0,T], \quad u(0)=I,
        

and display the solution on the screen, preferably together with the
exact solution. We shall also be concerned with how we can test
that the implementation is correct.

All programs referred to in this section are found in the
`src/decay <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/tree/gh-pages/src/decay>`_ directory.

*Mathematical problem.* We want to explore the Forward Euler scheme, the
Backward Euler, and the Crank-Nicolson schemes applied to our model problem.
From an implementational points of view, it is advantageous to
implement the :math:`\theta`-rule

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
        

since it can generate the three other schemes by various of
choices of :math:`\theta`: :math:`\theta=0` for Forward Euler, :math:`\theta =1` for
Backward Euler, and :math:`\theta =1/2` for Crank-Nicolson.
Given :math:`a`, :math:`u^0=I`, :math:`T`, and :math:`\Delta t`,
our task is to use the :math:`\theta`-rule to
compute :math:`u^1, u^2,\ldots,u^N`, where :math:`t_N=N\Delta t`, and
:math:`N` the closest integer to :math:`T/\Delta t`.

*Computer Language: Python.* Any programming language can be used to generate the :math:`u^{n+1}` values from
the formula above. However, in this document we shall mainly make use of
Python of several reasons:

  * Python has a very clean, readable syntax (often known as
    "executable pseudo-code").

  * Python code is very similar to MATLAB code (and MATLAB has a
    particularly widespread use for scientific computing).

  * Python is similar to, but much simpler to work with and
    results in more reliable code than C++.

  * Python is a full-fledged, very powerful programming language.

  * Python has a rich set of modules for scientific computing, and its
    popularity in scientific computing is rapidly growing.

  * Python was made for being combined with compiled languages
    (C, C++, Fortran) to reuse existing numerical software and to
    reach high computational performance of new implementations.

  * Python has extensive support for administrative task
    needed when doing large-scale computational investigations.

  * Python has extensive support for graphics (visualization,
    user interfaces, web applications).

  * FEniCS, a very powerful tool for solving PDEs by
    the finite element method, is most human-efficient to operate
    from Python.

Learning Python is easy. Many newcomers to the language will probably
learn enough from the examples to perform their own computer
experiments. The examples start with simple Python code and gradually
make use of more powerful constructs as we proceed. As long as it is
not inconvenient for the problem at hand, our Python code is made as
close as possible to MATLAB code for easy transition between the two
languages.

.. _decay:py1:

Making a solver function
------------------------

We choose to have an array ``u`` for storing the :math:`u^n` values, :math:`n=0,1,\ldots,N`.
The algorithmic steps are

 1. initialize :math:`u^0`

 2. for :math:`t=t_n`, :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N`: compute :math:`u_n` using
    the :math:`\theta`-rule formula

Function for computing the numerical solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following Python function takes the input data of the problem
(:math:`I`, :math:`a`, :math:`T`, :math:`\Delta t`, :math:`\theta`) as arguments and returns two arrays with
the solution :math:`u^0,\ldots,u^N` and the mesh points :math:`t_0,\ldots,t_N`,
respectively:


.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import *
        
        def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
            """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
            N = int(T/dt)            # no of time intervals
            T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
            u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
            t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh
        
            u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
            for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
                u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
            return u, t


The ``numpy`` library contains a lot of functions for array computing. Most
of the function names are similar to what is found
in the alternative scientific computing language MATLAB. Here
we make use of

 * ``zeros(N+1)`` for creating an array of a size ``N+1``
   and initializing the elements to zero

 * ``linspace(0, T, N+1)`` for creating an array with ``N+1`` coordinates uniformly
   distributed between ``0`` and ``T``

The ``for`` loop deserves a comment, especially for newcomers to Python.
The construction ``range(0, N, s)`` generates all integers from ``0`` to ``N``
in steps of ``s``, *but not including* ``N``. Omitting ``s`` means ``s=1``.
For example, ``range(0, 6, 3)``
gives ``0`` and ``3``, while ``range(0, N)`` generates ``0``, ``1``, ..., ``N-1``.
In our loop, ``n`` takes on the values generated by ``range(0, N)``,
implying the following assignments ``u[n+1]``: ``u[1]``, ``u[2]``, ...,
``u[N]``, which is what we want since ``u`` has length ``N+1``.
The first index in Python arrays or lists is *always* ``0`` and the
last is then ``len(u)-1``.

To compute with the ``solver`` function, we need to *call* it. Here
is a sample call:

.. code-block:: python

        u, t = solver(I=1, a=2, T=8, dt=0.8, theta=1)


Integer division
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The shown implementation of the ``solver`` may face problems and
wrong results if ``T``, ``a``, ``dt``, and ``theta`` are given as integers,
see :ref:`decay:exer:intdiv` and :ref:`decay:exer:decay1err`.
The problem is related to *integer division* in Python (as well as
in Fortran, C, and C++): ``1/2`` becomes ``0``,
while ``1.0/2``, ``1/2.0``, or ``1.0/2.0`` all become are ``0.5``. It is enough
that at least the nominator or the denominator is a real number
(i.e., a ``float`` object)
to ensure correct mathematical division. Inserting
a conversion ``dt = float(dt)``
guarantees that ``dt`` is
``float`` and avoids problems in :ref:`decay:exer:decay1err`.

Another problem with computing :math:`N=T/\Delta t` is that we should
round :math:`N` to the nearest integer. With ``N = int(T/dt)`` the ``int``
operation picks the largest integer smaller than ``T/dt``. Correct
rounding is obtained by

.. code-block:: python

        N = int(round(T/dt))

The complete version of our improved, safer ``solver`` function then becomes


.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import *
        
        def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
            """Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt."""
            dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
            N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
            T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
            u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
            t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh
        
            u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
            for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
                u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]
            return u, t



Doc strings
~~~~~~~~~~~


.. index:: doc strings


Right below the header line in the ``solver`` function there is a
Python string enclosed in triple double quotes ``"""``.
The purpose of this string object is to document what the function
does and what the arguments are. In this case the necessary
documentation do not span more than one line, but with triple double
quoted strings the text may span several lines:


.. code-block:: python

        def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
            """
            Solve
        
                u'(t) = -a*u(t),
        
            with initial condition u(0)=I, for t in the time interval
            (0,T]. The time interval is divided into time steps of
            length dt.
        
            theta=1 corresponds to the Backward Euler scheme, theta=0
            to the Forward Euler scheme, and theta=0.5 to the Crank-
            Nicolson method.
            """
            ...

Such documentation strings appearing right after the header of
a function are called *doc strings*. There are tools that can automatically
produce nicely formatted documentation by extracting the definition of
functions and the contents of doc strings.

It is strongly recommended to equip any function whose purpose
is not obvious with a doc string. Nevertheless, the forthcoming
text deviates from this rule if the function is explained in the text.


Formatting of numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having computed the discrete solution ``u``, it is natural to look at
the numbers:

.. code-block:: python

        # Write out a table of t and u values:
        for i in range(len(t)):
            print t[i], u[i]

This compact ``print`` statement gives unfortunately quite ugly output
because the ``t`` and ``u`` values are not aligned in nicely formatted columns.
To fix this problem, we recommend to use the *printf format*, supported most
programming languages inherited from C. Another choice is
Python's recent *format string syntax*.


.. index:: printf format (Python)


Writing ``t[i]`` and ``u[i]`` in two nicely formatted columns is done like
this with the printf format:


.. code-block:: python

        print 't=%6.3f u=%g' % (t[i], u[i])

The percentage signs signify "slots" in the text where the variables
listed at the end of the statement are inserted. For each "slot" one
must specify a format for how the variable is going to appear in the
string: ``s`` for pure text, ``d`` for an integer, ``g`` for a real number
written as compactly as possible, ``9.3E`` for scientific notation with
three decimals in a field of width 9 characters (e.g., ``-1.351E-2``),
or ``.2f`` for a standard decimal notation, here with two decimals,
formatted with minimum width. The printf syntax provides a quick way
of formatting tabular output of numbers with full control of the
layout.


.. index:: format string syntax (Python)


The alternative *format string syntax* looks like

.. code-block:: python

        print 't={t:6.3f} u={u:g}'.format(t=t[i], u=u[i])

As seen, this format allows logical names in the "slots" where
``t[i]`` and ``u[i]`` are to be inserted. The "slots" are surrounded
by curly braces, and the logical name is followed by a colon and
then the printf-like specification of how to format real numbers,
integers, or strings.

Running the program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The function and main program shown above must be placed in a file,
say with name `dc_v1.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_v1.py>`_.  Make sure you
write the code with a suitable text editor (Gedit, Emacs, Vim,
Notepad++, or similar).  The program is run by executing the file this
way:


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python dc_v1.py

The text ``Terminal>`` just signifies a prompt in a
Unix/Linux or DOS terminal window. After this prompt (which will look
different in your terminal window, depending on the terminal application
and how it is set up), commands like ``python dc_v1.py`` can be issued.
These commands are interpreted by the operating system.

We strongly recommend to run Python programs within the IPython shell.
First start IPython by typing ``ipython`` in the terminal window.
Inside the IPython shell, our program ``dc_v1.py`` is run by the command
``run dc_v1.py``.
The advantage of running programs in IPython are many: previous commands
are easily recalled, ``%pdb`` turns on debugging so that
variables can be examined if the program
aborts due to an exception, output of commands are stored in variables,
programs and statements can be profiled,
any operating system command can be executed, modules can be loaded
automatically and other customizations can be performed when starting
IPython -- to mention a few of the most
useful features.

Although running programs in IPython is strongly recommended, most
execution examples in the forthcoming text use the standard
Python shell with prompt ``>>>`` and run programs through
a typesetting like
``Terminal> python programname``. The reason is that such typesetting
makes the text more compact in the vertical direction
than showing sessions with IPython syntax.

Verifying the implementation
----------------------------

It is easy to make mistakes while deriving and implementing numerical
algorithms, so we should never believe in the printed :math:`u` values before
they have been thoroughly verified. The most obvious idea is to compare
the computed solution with the exact solution, when that exists,
but there will always be a discrepancy between these two solutions
because of the numerical approximations. The challenging question is whether
we have the mathematically correct discrepancy or if we have another,
maybe small, discrepancy due to both an approximation error
and an error in the implementation.

The purpose of *verifying* a program is to bring evidence for the
fact that there are no errors in the implementation. To avoid
mixing unavoidable approximation errors and undesired
implementation errors, we should
try to make tests where we have some exact computation of the
discrete solution or at least parts of it.

Running a few algorithmic steps by hand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest approach to produce a correct reference for the discrete
solution :math:`u` of finite difference equations is to compute a few
steps of the algorithm by hand. Then we can compare the hand
calculations with numbers produced by the program.

A straightforward approach is to use a calculator and
compute :math:`u^1`, :math:`u^2`, and :math:`u^3`. However, the chosen values of :math:`I` and :math:`\theta`
given in the execution example above are not good, because the
numbers 0 and 1 can easily
simplify formulas too much for test purposes. For example, with
:math:`\theta =1` the nominator in the formula for :math:`u^n` will be the same for
all :math:`a` and :math:`\Delta t` values. One should therefore choose more
"arbitrary" values, say :math:`\theta =0.8` and :math:`I=0.1`. Hand calculations
with the aid of a calculator gives


.. math::
         A\equiv \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a \Delta t} = 0.298245614035


.. math::
        
        u^1 &= AI=0.0298245614035,\\
        u^2 &= Au^1= 0.00889504462912,\\
        u^3 &=Au^2= 0.00265290804728
        


Comparison of these manual calculations with the result of the
``solver`` function is carried out in the function


.. code-block:: python

        def verify_three_steps():
            """Compare three steps with known manual computations."""
            theta = 0.8; a = 2; I = 0.1; dt = 0.8
            u_by_hand = array([I,
                               0.0298245614035,
                               0.00889504462912,
                               0.00265290804728])
        
            N = 3  # number of time steps
            u, t = solver(I=I, a=a, T=N*dt, dt=dt, theta=theta)
        
            tol = 1E-15  # tolerance for comparing floats
            difference = abs(u - u_by_hand).max()
            success = difference <= tol
            return success


The main program, where we call the ``solver`` function and print ``u``,
is now put in a separate function ``main``:


.. code-block:: python

        def main():
            u, t = solver(I=1, a=2, T=8, dt=0.8, theta=1)
            # Write out a table of t and u values:
            for i in range(len(t)):
                print 't=%6.3f u=%g' % (t[i], u[i])
                # or print 't={t:6.3f} u={u:g}'.format(t=t[i], u=u[i])


The main program in the file may now first run the verification test
and then go on with the real simulation (``main()``) only if the test is passed:


.. code-block:: python

        if verify_three_steps():
            main()
        else:
            print 'Bug in the implementation!'


Since the verification test is always done, future errors introduced
accidentally in the program have a good chance of being detected.

It is essential that verification tests can be automatically run
at *any* time. For this purpose,
there are test frameworks and corresponding programming
rules that allow us to request running through a suite of test cases,
but in this very early stage of program development we just implement
and run the verification in our own code so that every detail is
visible and understood.

The complete program including the ``verify_three_steps*`` functions is
found in the file `dc_verf1.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_verf1.py>`_.

Comparison with an exact discrete solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes it is possible to find a closed-form
*exact discrete solution* that fulfills the discrete finite
difference equations. The implementation can then be verified against
the exact discrete solution. This is usually the best technique for
verification.

.. Not so limited, will later guess that linear functions and MMS can

.. be used in the discrete eqs as well!


Define

.. math::
         A = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a \Delta t}\thinspace . 

Manual computations with the :math:`\theta`-rule results in

.. math::
        
        u^0 &= I,\\
        u^1 &= Au^0 = AI,\\
        u^2 &= Au^1 = A^2I,\\
        &\vdots\\
        u^n &= A^nu^{n-1} = A^nI \thinspace .
        

We have then established the exact discrete solution as

.. math::
   :label: decay:un:exact
        
        u^n = IA^n
        
        \thinspace .
        

One should be conscious about the different meanings of the notation
on the left- and right-hand side
of this equation: on the left, :math:`n` is a superscript reflecting a counter
of mesh points, while on the right, :math:`n` is the power in an exponentiation.

Comparison of the exact discrete solution and the computed
solution is done in the following function:


.. code-block:: python

        def verify_exact_discrete_solution():
        
            def exact_discrete_solution(n, I, a, theta, dt):
                factor = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)
                return I*factor**n
        
            theta = 0.8; a = 2; I = 0.1; dt = 0.8
            N = int(8/dt)  # no of steps
            u, t = solver(I=I, a=a, T=N*dt, dt=dt, theta=theta)
            u_de = array([exact_discrete_solution(n, I, a, theta, dt)
                          for n in range(N+1)])
            difference = abs(u_de - u).max()  # max deviation
            tol = 1E-15  # tolerance for comparing floats
            success = difference <= tol
            return success

Note that one can define a function inside another function (but such
a function is invisible outside the function in which it is defined).
The complete program is found in the file `dc_verf2.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_verf2.py>`_.


.. _decay:computing:error:

Computing the numerical error
-----------------------------

Now that we have evidence for a correct implementation, we are in a
position to compare the computed :math:`u^n` values in the ``u`` array with
the exact :math:`u` values at the mesh points, in order to study the error
in the numerical solution.

Let us first make a function for the analytical solution :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}(t)=Ie^{-at}`
of the model problem:


.. code-block:: python

        def exact_solution(t, I, a):
            return I*exp(-a*t)


A natural way to compare the exact and discrete solutions is to
calculate their difference at the mesh points:


.. math::
        
        e_n = u_{\small\mbox{e}}(t_n) - u^n,\quad n=0,1,\ldots,N \thinspace .
        

These numbers are conveniently computed by


.. code-block:: python

        u, t = solver(I, a, T, dt, theta)  # Numerical solution
        u_e = exact_solution(t, I, a)
        e = u_e - u

The last two statements make use of array arithmetics: ``t`` is an
array of mesh points that we pass to ``exact_solution``. This function
evaluates ``-a*t``, which is a scalar times an array, meaning that
the scalar is multiplied with each array element.
The result is an array, let us call it ``tmp1``. Then
``exp(tmp1)`` means applying the exponential function to each element in
``tmp``, resulting an array, say ``tmp2``. Finally, ``I*tmp2`` is computed
(scalar times array) and ``u_e`` refers to this array returned from
``exact_solution``. The expression ``u_e - u`` is the difference between
two arrays, resulting in a new array referred to by ``e``.

The array ``e`` is the current problem's discrete *error function*. Very
often we want to work with just one number reflecting the size of the
error. A common choice is to integrate :math:`e_n^2` over the mesh and take
the square root.  Assuming the exact and discrete solution to vary
linearly between the mesh points, the integral is given exactly by the
Trapezoidal rule:


.. math::
         \hat E^2 = \Delta t\left(\frac{1}{2}e_0^2 + \frac{1}{2}e_N^2
        + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} e_n^2\right) 

A common approximation of this expression, for convenience, is


.. math::
         \hat E^2 \approx E^2 = \Delta t\sum_{n=0}^{N} e_n^2 

The error in this approximation is not much of a concern: it means that
the error measure is not exactly the Trapezoidal rule of an integral, but
a slightly different measure. We could equally well have chosen other
error messages, but the choice is not important as long as we use the
same error measure consistently in all experiments
when investigating the error.

The error measure :math:`\hat E` or :math:`E` is referred to as the
:math:`L_2` norm of the discrete error function.
The formula for :math:`E` will be frequently used:

.. math::
   :label: decay:E
        
        E = \sqrt{\Delta t\sum_{n=0}^N e_n^2}
        
        

The corresponding Python code, using array arithmetics, reads


.. code-block:: python

        E = sqrt(dt*sum(e**2))

The ``sum`` function comes from ``numpy`` and computes the sum of the elements
of an array. Also the ``sqrt`` function is from ``numpy`` and computes the
square root of each element in the array argument.

Instead of doing array computing we can compute with
one element at a time:

.. code-block:: python

        m = len(u)     # length of u array (alt: u.size)
        u_e = zeros(m)
        t = 0
        for i in range(m):
            u_e[i] = exact_solution(t, a, I)
            t = t + dt
        e = zeros(m)
        for i in range(m):
            e[i] = u_e[i] - u[i]
        s = 0  # summation variable
        for i in range(m):
            s = s + e[i]**2
        error = sqrt(dt*s)

Such element-wise computing, often called *scalar* computing, takes
more code, is less readable, and runs much slower than array computing.


Plotting solutions
------------------

Having the ``t`` and ``u`` arrays, the approximate solution ``u`` is visualized
by ``plot(t, u)``:


.. code-block:: python

        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        plot(t, u)
        show()

It will be illustrative to also plot :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}(t)` for comparison. Doing a
``plot(t, u_e)`` is not exactly what we want: the ``plot`` function draws
straight lines between the discrete points ``(t[n], u_e[n])`` while
:math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}(t)` varies as an exponential function between the mesh points.
The technique for showing the "exact" variation of :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}(t)` between
the mesh points is to introduce a very fine mesh for :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}(t)`:


.. code-block:: python

        t_e = linspace(0, T, 1001)      # fine mesh
        u_e = exact_solution(t_e, I, a)
        plot(t,   u,   'r-')            # red  line for u
        plot(t_e, u_e, 'b-')            # blue line for u_e


With more than one curve in the plot we need to associate each curve
with a legend. We also want appropriate names on the axis, a title,
and a file containing the plot as an image for inclusion in reports.
The Matplotlib package (``matplotlib.pyplot``) contains functions for
this purpose. The names of the functions are similar to the plotting
functions known from MATLAB.  A complete plot session then becomes


.. code-block:: python

        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        
        figure()                          # create new plot
        t_e = linspace(0, T, 1001)        # fine mesh for u_e
        u_e = exact_solution(t_e, I, a)
        plot(t,   u,   'r--o')            # red dashes w/circles
        plot(t_e, u_e, 'b-')              # blue line for exact sol.
        legend(['numerical', 'exact'])
        xlabel('t')
        ylabel('u')
        title('theta=%g, dt=%g' % (theta, dt))
        savefig('%s_%g.png' % (theta, dt))
        show()

Note that ``savefig`` here creates a PNG file whose name reflects the
values of :math:`\theta` and :math:`\Delta t` so that we can easily distinguish
files from different runs with :math:`\theta` and :math:`\Delta t`.

A bit more sophisticated and easy-to-read filename can be generated
by mapping the :math:`\theta` value to acronyms for the three common
schemes: FE (Forward Euler, :math:`\theta=0`), BE (Backward Euler, :math:`\theta=1`),
CN (Crank-Nicolson, :math:`\theta=0.5`). A Python dictionary is ideal for such
a mapping from numbers to strings:


.. code-block:: python

        theta2name = {0: 'FE', 1: 'BE', 0.5: 'CN'}
        savefig('%s_%g.png' % (theta2name[theta], dt))


Let us wrap up the computation of the error measure and all the
plotting statements in a function ``explore``. This function
can be called for various :math:`\theta` and :math:`\Delta t` values
to see how the error varies with the method and the mesh resolution:


.. code-block:: python

        def explore(I, a, T, dt, theta=0.5, makeplot=True):
            """
            Run a case with the solver, compute error measure,
            and plot the numerical and exact solutions (if makeplot=True).
            """
            u, t = solver(I, a, T, dt, theta)  # Numerical solution
            u_e = exact_solution(t, I, a)
            e = u_e - u
            E = sqrt(dt*sum(e**2))
            if makeplot:
                figure()                         # create new plot
                t_e = linspace(0, T, 1001)       # fine mesh for u_e
                u_e = exact_solution(t_e, I, a)
                plot(t,   u,   'r--o')           # red dashes w/circles
                plot(t_e, u_e, 'b-')             # blue line for exact sol.
                legend(['numerical', 'exact'])
                xlabel('t')
                ylabel('u')
                title('theta=%g, dt=%g' % (theta, dt))
                theta2name = {0: 'FE', 1: 'BE', 0.5: 'CN'}
                savefig('%s_%g.png' % (theta2name[theta], dt))
                savefig('%s_%g.pdf' % (theta2name[theta], dt))
                savefig('%s_%g.eps' % (theta2name[theta], dt))
                show()
            return E


The ``figure()`` call is key here: without it, a new ``plot`` command will
draw the new pair of curves in the same plot window, while we want
the different pairs to appear in separate windows and files.
Calling ``figure()`` ensures this.


.. index:: PNG plot

.. index:: PDF plot

.. index:: EPS plot


.. index::
   single: view; PNG plot

.. index::
   single: view; PDF plot

.. index::
   single: view; EPS plot


The ``explore`` function stores the plot in three different image file formats:
PNG, PDF, and EPS (Encapsulated PostScript). The PNG format is aimed
at being included in HTML files, the PDF format in pdfLaTeX documents,
and the EPS format in LaTeX documents. Frequently used viewers for these
image files on Unix systems are ``gv`` (comes with Ghostscript)
for the PDF and EPS formats and
``display`` (from the ImageMagick) suite for PNG files:


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> gv BE_0.5.pdf
        Terminal> gv BE_0.5.eps
        Terminal> display BE_0.5.png


The complete code containing the functions above
resides in the file `dc_plot_mpl.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_plot_mpl.py>`_.
Running this program results in

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python dc_plot_mpl.py
        0.0   0.40:    2.105E-01
        0.0   0.04:    1.449E-02
        0.5   0.40:    3.362E-02
        0.5   0.04:    1.887E-04
        1.0   0.40:    1.030E-01
        1.0   0.04:    1.382E-02

We observe that reducing :math:`\Delta t` by a factor of 10 increases the
accuracy for all three methods (:math:`\theta` values). We also see that
the combination of :math:`\theta=0.5` and a small time step :math:`\Delta t =0.04`
gives a much more accurate solution, and that :math:`\theta=0` and :math:`\theta=0`
with :math:`\Delta t = 0.4` result in the least accurate solutions.

Figure :ref:`decay:fig:FE1` demonstrates that the numerical solution for
:math:`\Delta t=0.4` clearly lies below the exact curve, but that the
accuracy improves considerably by using 1/10 of this time step.


.. _decay:fig:FE1:

.. figure:: fig-decay/FE1.png
   :width: 600

   *The Forward Euler scheme for two values of the time step*


Mounting two PNG files, as done in the figure, is easily done by the
`montage <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/montage.php>`_ program
from the ImageMagick suite:


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> montage -background white -geometry 100% -tile 2x1 \
                  FE_0.4.png FE_0.04.png FE1.png
        Terminal> convert -trim FE1.png FE1.png

The ``-geometry`` argument is used to specify the size of the image, and here
we preserve the individual sizes of the images. The ``-tile HxV`` option
specifies ``H`` images in the horizontal direction and ``V`` images in
the vertical direction. A series of image files to be combined are then listed,
with the name of the resulting combined image, here ``FE1.png`` at the end.
The ``convert -trim`` command removes surrounding white areas in the figure.

For \LaTeX{} reports it is not recommended to use ``montage`` and PNG files
as the result has too low resolution. Instead, plots should be made
in the PDF format and combined using the ``pdftk``, ``pdfnup``, and ``pdfcrop`` tools
(on Linux/Unix):


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> pdftk FE_0.4.png FE_0.04.png output tmp.pdf
        Terminal> pdfnup --nup 2x1 tmp.pdf     # output in tmp-nup.pdf
        Terminal> pdfcrop tmp-nup.pdf tmp.pdf  # output in tmp.pdf
        Terminal> mv tmp.pdf FE1.png

Here, ``pdftk`` combines images into a multi-page PDF file, ``pdfnup``
combines the images in individual pages to a table of images (pages),
and ``pdfcrop`` removes white margins in the resulting combined image file.

The behavior of the two other schemes is shown in Figures :ref:`decay:fig:BE1`
and :ref:`decay:fig:CN1`. Crank-Nicolson is obviously the most accurate
scheme from this visual point of view.

Plotting with SciTools
----------------------

The `SciTools package <http://code.google.com/p/scitools>`_ provides a
unified plotting interface, called Easyviz, to many different plotting
packages, including Matplotlib. The syntax is very similar to that of
Matplotlib and MATLAB. In fact, the plotting commands shown above look
the same in SciTool's Easyviz interface, apart from the import
statement, which reads


.. code-block:: python

        from scitools.std import *

This statement performs a ``from numpy import *`` as well as an import
of the most common pieces of the Easyviz (``scitools.easyviz``) package,
along with some additional numerical functionality.

With Easyviz one can, using an extended ``plot`` command,
merge several plotting commands into one,
using keyword arguments:


.. code-block:: python

        plot(t,   u,   'r--o',           # red dashes w/circles
             t_e, u_e, 'b-',             # blue line for exact sol.
             legend=['numerical', 'exact'],
             xlabel='t',
             ylabel='u',
             title='theta=%g, dt=%g' % (theta, dt),
             savefig='%s_%g.png' % (theta2name[theta], dt),
             show=True)

The `dc_plot_st.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_plot_st.py>`_ file
contains such a demo.

By default, Easyviz employs Matplotlib for plotting, but `Gnuplot <http://www.gnuplot.info/>`_ and `Grace <http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/>`_ are viable alternatives:


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python dc_plot_st.py --SCITOOLS_easyviz_backend gnuplot
        Terminal> python dc_plot_st.py --SCITOOLS_easyviz_backend grace

The backend used for creating plots (and numerous other options)
can be permanently set in SciTool's configuration file.

All the Gnuplot windows are launched without any need to kill one before
the next one pops up (as is the case with Matplotlib) and one can
press the key 'q' anywhere in a plot window to kill it.
Another advantage of Gnuplot is the automatic choice of sensible
and distinguishable line types in black-and-white PostScript
files (produced by ``savefig('myplot.eps')``).

Regarding functionality for annotating plots with title, labels on the
axis, legends, etc., we refer to the documentation of Matplotlib and
SciTools for more detailed information on the syntax. The hope is that
the programming syntax explained so far suffices for understanding the
code and learning more from a combination of the forthcoming examples
and other resources such as books and web pages.

Creating user interfaces
------------------------


.. index:: user interfaces to programs


.. index:: command-line interfaces


It is good programming practice to let programs read input from the user
rather than require the user to edit the source code when trying out
new values of input parameters.
Reading input from the command line is a simple and flexible way of interacting
with the user. Python stores all the command-line arguments in
the list ``sys.argv``, and there are, in principle, two ways of programming with
command-line arguments in Python:

 * Decide upon a sequence of parameters on the command line and read
   their values directly from the ``sys.argv[1:]`` list (``sys.argv[0]`` is
   the just program name).

 * Use option-value pairs (``--option value``) on
   the command line to override default values of input parameters,
   and use the ``argparse.ArgumentParser`` tool to interact with the command line.

Both strategies will be illustrated next.

Reading a sequence of command-line arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. index:: reading the command line


The `dc_plot_mpl.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_plot_mpl.py>`_
program needs the following input data: :math:`I`, :math:`a`, :math:`T`, an option to
turn the plot on or off (``makeplot``), and a list of :math:`\Delta t` values.

The simplest way of reading this input from the command line is to say
that the first four command-line arguments correspond to the first
four points in the list above, in that order, and that the rest of the
command-line arguments are the :math:`\Delta t` values.  The input given for
``makeplot`` can be a string among ``'on'``, ``'off'``, ``'True'``, and
``'False'``. The code for reading this input is most conveniently put in
a function:


.. code-block:: python

        import sys
        
        def read_command_line():
            if len(sys.argv) < 6:
                print 'Usage: %s I a T on/off dt1 dt2 dt3 ...' % \ 
                      sys.argv[0]; sys.exit(1)  # abort
        
            I = float(sys.argv[1])
            a = float(sys.argv[2])
            T = float(sys.argv[3])
            makeplot = sys.argv[4] in ('on', 'True')
            dt_values = [float(arg) for arg in sys.argv[5:]]
        
            return I, a, T, makeplot, dt_values



.. index:: list comprehension


.. index:: sys.argv


One should note the following about the constructions in the program above:

  * Everything on the command line ends up in a *string* in
    the list ``sys.argv``. Explicit conversion to, e.g., a ``float`` object is
    required if the string as a number we want to compute with.

  * The value of ``makeplot`` is determined from a boolean expression,
    which becomes ``True`` if the command-line argument is either ``'on'`` or
    ``'True'``, and ``False`` otherwise.

  * It is easy to build the list of :math:`\Delta t` values: we simply run through
    the rest of the list, ``sys.argv[5:]``, convert each command-line argument
    to ``float``, and collect these ``float`` objects in a list, using the
    compact and convenient *list comprehension* syntax in Python.

The loops over :math:`\theta` and :math:`\Delta t` values can be coded in a ``main`` function:


.. code-block:: python

        def main():
            I, a, T, makeplot, dt_values = read_command_line()
            for theta in 0, 0.5, 1:
                for dt in dt_values:
                    E = explore(I, a, T, dt, theta, makeplot)
                    print '%3.1f %6.2f: %12.3E' % (theta, dt, E)


The complete program can be found in `dc_cml.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_cml.py>`_.

Working with an argument parser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. index:: argparse (Python module)


.. index:: ArgumentParser (Python class)


.. index:: option-value pairs (command line)


.. index:: command-line options and values


.. index:: reading the command line


Python's ``ArgumentParser`` tool in the ``argparse`` module makes it
easy to create a professional command-line interface to any
program. The `documentation of `ArgumentParser` <http://docs.python.org/library/argparse.html>`_ demonstrates its
versatile applications, so we shall here just list an example
containing the most used features.  On the command line we want to
specify option value pairs for :math:`I`, :math:`a`, and :math:`T`, e.g., ``--a 3.5 --I 2
--T 2``. Including ``--makeplot`` turns the plot on and excluding this
option turns the plot off.  The :math:`\Delta t` values can be given as
``--dt 1 0.5 0.25 0.1 0.01``.  Each parameter must have a sensible
default value so that we specify the option on the command line only
when the default value is not suitable.

We introduce a function for defining the mentioned command-line options:


.. code-block:: python

        def define_command_line_options():
            import argparse
            parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
            parser.add_argument('--I', '--initial_condition', type=float,
                                default=1.0, help='initial condition, u(0)',
                                metavar='I')
            parser.add_argument('--a', type=float,
                                default=1.0, help='coefficient in ODE',
                                metavar='a')
            parser.add_argument('--T', '--stop_time', type=float,
                                default=1.0, help='end time of simulation',
                                metavar='T')
            parser.add_argument('--makeplot', action='store_true',
                                help='display plot or not')
            parser.add_argument('--dt', '--time_step_values', type=float,
                                default=[1.0], help='time step values',
                                metavar='dt', nargs='+', dest='dt_values')
            return parser


Each command-line option is defined through the ``parser.add_argument``
method. Alternative options, like the short ``--I`` and the more
explaining version ``--initial_condition`` can be defined. Other arguments
are ``type`` for the Python object type, a default value, and a help
string, which gets printed if the command-line argument ``-h`` or ``--help`` is
included. The ``metavar`` argument specifies the value associated with
the option when the help string is printed. For example, the option for
:math:`I` has this help output:


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python dc_argparse.py -h
          ...
          --I I, --initial_condition I
                                initial condition, u(0)
          ...

The structure of this output is


.. code-block:: text


          --I metavar, --initial_condition metavar
                                help-string


The ``--makeplot`` option is a pure flag without any value, implying a
true value if the flag is present and otherwise a false value. The
``action='store_true'`` makes an option for such a flag.

Finally, the ``--dt`` option demonstrates how to allow for more than one
value (separated by blanks) through the ``nargs='+'`` keyword argument.
After the command line is parsed, we get an object where the values of
the options are stored as attributes. The attribute name is specified
by the ``dist`` keyword argument, which for the ``--dt`` option reads
``dt_values``. Without the ``dest`` argument, the value of option ``--opt``
is stored as the attribute ``opt``.

The code below demonstrates how to read the command line and extract
the values for each option:


.. code-block:: python

        def read_command_line():
            parser = define_command_line_options()
            args = parser.parse_args()
            print 'I={}, a={}, T={}, makeplot={}, dt_values={}'.format(
                args.I, args.a, args.T, args.makeplot, args.dt_values)
            return args.I, args.a, args.T, args.makeplot, args.dt_values


The ``main`` function remains the same as in the ``dc_cml.py`` code based
on reading from ``sys.argv`` directly. A complete program using the
demo above of ``ArgumentParser`` appears in the file `dc_argparse.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_argparse.py>`_.


.. _decay:convergence:rate:

Computing convergence rates
---------------------------


.. index:: convergence rate


We normally expect that the error :math:`E` in the numerical solution is
reduced if the mesh size :math:`\Delta t` is decreased. More specifically,
many numerical methods obey a power-law relation between :math:`E` and
:math:`\Delta t`:


.. math::
   :label: decay:E:dt
        
        E = C\Delta t^r,
        
        

where :math:`C` and :math:`r` are (usually unknown) constants independent of :math:`\Delta t`.
The formula :eq:`decay:E:dt` is viewed as an asymptotic model valid for
sufficiently small :math:`\Delta t`. How small is normally hard to estimate
without doing numerical estimations of :math:`r`.

The parameter :math:`r` is known as the *convergence rate*. For example,
if the convergence rate is 2, halving :math:`\Delta t` reduces the error by
a factor of 4. Diminishing :math:`\Delta t` then has a greater impact on
the error compared with methods that have :math:`r=1`. For a given value of :math:`r`,
we refer to the method as of :math:`r`-th order. First- and second-order
methods are most common in scientific computing.

Estimating :math:`r`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways of estimating :math:`C` and :math:`r` based on a set of
:math:`m` simulations with corresponding pairs :math:`(\Delta t_i, E_i)`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,m-1`,
and :math:`\Delta t_{i} < \Delta t_{i-1}` (i.e., decreasing cell size).

 1. Take the logarithm of :eq:`decay:E:dt`, :math:`\ln E = r\ln \Delta t + \ln C`,
    and fit a straight line to the data points :math:`(\Delta t_i, E_i)`,
    :math:`i=0,\ldots,m-1`.

 2. Consider two consecutive experiments, :math:`(\Delta t_i, E_i)` and
    :math:`(\Delta t_{i-1}, E_{i-1})`. Dividing the equation
    :math:`E_{i-1}=C\Delta t_{i-1}^r` by :math:`E_{i}=C\Delta t_{i}^r` and solving
    for :math:`r` yields


.. math::
   :label: decay:conv:rate
        
        r_{i-1} = \frac{\ln (E_{i-1}/E_i)}{\ln (\Delta t_{i-1}/\Delta t_i)}
        
        

for :math:`i=1,=\ldots,m-1`.

The disadvantage of method 1 is that :eq:`decay:E:dt` might not be valid
for the coarsest meshes (largest :math:`\Delta t` values), and fitting a line
to all the data points is then misleading.  Method 2 computes
convergence rates for pairs of experiments and allows us to see
if the sequence :math:`r_i` converges to some value as :math:`i\rightarrow m-2`.
The final :math:`r_{m-2}` can then be taken as the convergence rate.
If the coarsest meshes have a differing rate, the corresponding
time steps are probably too large for :eq:`decay:E:dt` to be valid.
That is, those time steps lie outside the asymptotic range of
:math:`\Delta t` values where the error behave like :eq:`decay:E:dt`.


Implementation  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is straightforward to extend the ``main`` function in the program
``dc_argparse.py`` with statements for computing :math:`r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_{m-2}`
from :eq:`decay:E:dt`:


.. code-block:: python

        from math import log
        
        def main():
            I, a, T, makeplot, dt_values = read_command_line()
            r = {}  # estimated convergence rates
            for theta in 0, 0.5, 1:
                E_values = []
                for dt in dt_values:
                    E = explore(I, a, T, dt, theta, makeplot=False)
                    E_values.append(E)
        
                # Compute convergence rates
                m = len(dt_values)
                r[theta] = [log(E_values[i-1]/E_values[i])/
                            log(dt_values[i-1]/dt_values[i])
                            for i in range(1, m, 1)]
        
            for theta in r:
                print '\nPairwise convergence rates for theta=%g:' % theta
                print ' '.join(['%.2f' % r_ for r_ in r[theta]])
            return r

The program is called `dc_convrate.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_convrate.py>`_.


.. index:: dictionary


The ``r`` object is a *dictionary of lists*. The keys in this
dictionary are the :math:`\theta` values. For example,
``r[1]`` holds the list of the :math:`r_i` values corresponding to
:math:`\theta=1`. In the loop ``for theta in r``, the loop variable ``theta``
takes on the values of the keys in the dictionary ``r`` (in an
undetermined ordering). We could simply do a ``print r[theta]``
inside the loop, but this would typically yield output of
the convergence rates with 16 decimals:


.. code-block:: python

        [1.331919482274763, 1.1488178494691532, ...]


Instead, we format each number with 2 decimals, using a list
comprehension to turn the list of numbers, ``r[theta]``, into
a list of formatted strings. Then we join these strings
with a space in between to get a sequence of rates on one line
in the terminal window. More generally, ``d.join(list)`` joins the
strings in the list ``list`` to one string, with ``d``
as delimiter between ``list[0]``, ``list[1]``, etc.

Here is an example on the outcome of the convergence rate computations:

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python dc_convrate.py --dt 0.5 0.25 0.1 0.05 0.025 0.01
        ...
        Pairwise convergence rates for theta=0:
        1.33 1.15 1.07 1.03 1.02
        
        Pairwise convergence rates for theta=0.5:
        2.14 2.07 2.03 2.01 2.01
        
        Pairwise convergence rates for theta=1:
        0.98 0.99 0.99 1.00 1.00

The Forward and Backward Euler methods seem to have an :math:`r` value which
stabilizes at 1, while the Crank-Nicolson seems to be a second-order
method with :math:`r=2`.


.. index:: verification


Very often, we have some theory that predicts what :math:`r` is for a numerical
method. Various theoretical error measures for the :math:`\theta`-rule point to
:math:`r=2` for :math:`\theta =0.5` and :math:`r=1` otherwise. The computed estimates of :math:`r` are
in very good agreement with these theoretical values.

The strong practical application of computing convergence rates is for
verification: wrong convergence rates point to errors in the code, and
correct convergence rates brings evidence that the implementation is
correct. Experience shows that bugs in the code easily destroys the
expected convergence rate.

Debugging via convergence rates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us experiment with bugs and see the implication on the convergence
rate. We may, for instance, forget to multiply by ``a`` in the denominator
in the updating formula for ``u[n+1]``:


.. code-block:: python

        u[n+1] = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt)*u[n]

Running the same ``dc_convrate.py`` command as above gives the expected
convergence rates (!). Why? The reason is that we just specified
the :math:`\Delta t` values are relied on default values for other
parameters. The default value of :math:`a` is 1. Forgetting the factor
``a`` has then no effect. This example shows how importance it is to
avoid parameters that are 1 or 0 when verifying implementations.
Running the code ``dc_v0.py`` with :math:`a=2.1` and :math:`I=0.1` yields


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python dc_convrate.py --a 2.1 --I 0.1  \
                  --dt 0.5 0.25 0.1 0.05 0.025 0.01
        ...
        Pairwise convergence rates for theta=0:
        1.49 1.18 1.07 1.04 1.02
        
        Pairwise convergence rates for theta=0.5:
        -1.42 -0.22 -0.07 -0.03 -0.01
        
        Pairwise convergence rates for theta=1:
        0.21 0.12 0.06 0.03 0.01

This time we see that the expected convergence rates for the Crank-Nicolson and
Backward Euler methods are not obtained, while :math:`r=1` for the Forward Euler
method. The reason for correct rate in the latter case is that :math:`\theta=0`
and the wrong ``theta*dt`` term in the denominator vanishes anyway.

The error


.. code-block:: python

        u[n+1] = ((1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u[n]

manifests itself through wrong rates :math:`r\approx 0` for all three methods.
About the same results arise from an erroneous initial condition, ``u[0] = 1``,
or wrong loop limits, ``range(1,N)``. It seems that in this simple
problem, most bugs we can think of are detected by the convergence rate
test, provided the values of the input data do not hide the bug.

A ``verify_convergence_rate`` function could compute the dictionary of
list via ``main`` and check if the final rate estimates (:math:`r_{m-2}`)
are sufficiently close to the expected ones. A tolerance of 0.1
seems appropriate, given the uncertainty in estimating :math:`r`:


.. code-block:: python

        def verify_convergence_rate():
            r = main()
            tol = 0.1
            expected_rates = {0: 1, 1: 1, 0.5: 2}
            for theta in r:
                r_final = r[theta][-1]
                diff = abs(expected_rates[theta] - r_final)
                if diff > tol:
                    return False
            return True  # all tests passed

We remark that ``r[theta]`` is a list and the last element in any list
can be extracted by the index ``-1``.



Memory-saving implementation
----------------------------

The memory storage requirements of our implementations so far consists
mainly of the ``u`` and ``t`` arrays, both of length :math:`N+1`, plus some other
temporary arrays that Python needs for intermediate results if we do
array arithmetics in our program (e.g., ``I*exp(-a*t)`` needs to store
``a*t`` before ``-`` can be applied to it and then ``exp``).  The
extremely modest storage requirements of simple ODE problems put no
restrictions on the formulations of the algorithm and implementation.
Nevertheless, when the methods for ODEs used here are applied to
three-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE) problems,
memory storage requirements
suddenly become an issue.

The PDE counterpart to our model problem
:math:`u'=-a` is a diffusion equation :math:`u_t = a\nabla^2 u` posed on a
space-time domain. The discrete representation of this domain may in
3D be a spatial mesh of :math:`M^3` points and a time mesh of :math:`N` points. A
typical desired value for :math:`M` is 100 in many applications, or even
:math:`1000`.  Storing all the computed :math:`u` values, like we have done in the
programs so far, demands storage of some arrays of size :math:`M^3N`, giving
a factor of :math:`M^3` larger storage demands compared to our ODE
programs. Each real number in the array for :math:`u` requires 8 bytes of
storage, resulting in a demand for 8 Gb of memory for only one array.
In such cases one needs good ideas on how to lower the storage
requirements. Fortunately, we can usually get rid of the :math:`M^3`
factor. Below we explain how this is done, and the technique is almost
always applied in implementations of PDE problems.

.. Fortunately, the methods we use to solve ODEs

.. and PDEs were mostly developed in a time where the size of a computer's

.. memory was very small compared to today's standards, and researchers

.. were therefore forced to always minimize the memory usage. As a result of

.. these circumstances, there is still a very strong focus on reducing

.. memory requirements in scientific computing algorithms.


Let us critically evaluate how much we really need to store in the
computer's memory in our implementation of the :math:`\theta` method. To
compute a new :math:`u^{n+1}`, all we need is :math:`u^n`. This implies that the
previous :math:`u^{n-1},u^{n-2},\dots,u^0` values do not need to be stored
in an array, although this is convenient for plotting and data
analysis in the program.  Instead of the ``u`` array we can work with
two variables for real numbers, ``u`` and ``u_1``, representing
:math:`u^{n+1}` and :math:`u^n` in the algorithm, respectively.  At each time
level, we update ``u`` from ``u_1`` and then set ``u_1 = u`` so that the
computed :math:`u^{n+1}` value becomes the "previous" value :math:`u^n` at the
next time level. The downside is that we cannot plot the solution
after the simulation is done since only the last two numbers are
available.  The remedy is to store computed values in a file and use
the file for visualizing the solution later.

We have implemented this memory saving idea in the file `dc_memsave.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_memsave.py>`_, which is a
merge of the `dc_plot_mpl.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_plot_mpl.py>`_ and
`dc_argparse.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_argparse.py>`_
programs, using module prefixes ``np`` for ``numpy`` and ``plt`` for
``matplotlib.pyplot``.

The following function implements the ideas above regarding minimizing
memory usage and storing the solution on file:


.. code-block:: python

        def solver_memsave(I, a, T, dt, theta, filename='sol.dat'):
            """
            Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt.
            Minimum use of memory. The solution is store on file
            (with name filename) for later plotting.
            """
            dt = float(dt)        # avoid integer division
            N = int(round(T/dt))  # no of intervals
        
            outfile = open(filename, 'w')
            # u: time level n+1, u_1: time level n
            t = 0
            u_1 = I
            outfile.write('%.16E  %.16E\n' % (t, u_1))
            for n in range(1, N+1):
                u = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)*u_1
                u_1 = u
                t += dt
                outfile.write('%.16E  %.16E\n' % (t, u))
            outfile.close()
            return u, t

This code snippet serves as a quick introduction to file writing in Python.
Reading the data in the file into arrays ``t`` and ``u`` are done by the
function


.. code-block:: python

        def read_file(filename='sol.dat'):
            infile = open(filename, 'r')
            u = [];  t = []
            for line in infile:
                words = line.split()
                if len(words) != 2:
                    print 'Found more than two numbers on a line!', words
                    sys.exit(1)  # abort
                t.append(float(words[0]))
                u.append(float(words[1]))
            return np.array(t), np.array(u)


This type of file with numbers in rows and columns is very common, and ``numpy``
has a function ``loadtxt`` which loads such tabular data into a two-dimensional
array, say ``data``. The number in row ``i`` and column ``j`` is then ``data[i,j]``.
The whole column number ``j`` can be extracted by ``data[:,j]``.
A version of ``read_file`` using ``np.loadtxt`` reads


.. code-block:: python

        def read_file_numpy(filename='sol.dat'):
            data = np.loadtxt(filename)
            t = data[:,0]
            u = data[:,1]
            return t, u


The present counterpart to the ``explore`` function from
`dc_plot_mpl.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_plot_mpl.py>`_ must run
``solver_memsave`` and then load data from file before we can compute
the error measure and make the plot:


.. code-block:: python

        def explore(I, a, T, dt, theta=0.5, makeplot=True):
            filename = 'u.dat'
            u, t = solver_memsave(I, a, T, dt, theta, filename)
        
            t, u = read_file(filename)
            u_e = exact_solution(t, I, a)
            e = u_e - u
            E = np.sqrt(dt*np.sum(e**2))
            if makeplot:
                plt.figure()
                ...


The `dc_memsave.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_memsave.py>`_
file also includes command-line options ``--I``, ``--a``, ``--T``, ``--dt``,
``--theta``, and ``--makeplot`` for controlling input parameters and
making a single run.  For example,


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python dc_memsave.py --T 10 --theta 1 --dt 2
        I=1.0, a=1.0, T=10.0, makeplot=True, theta=1.0, dt=2.0
        theta=1.0 dt=2 Error=3.136E-01





Software engineering
====================

Efficient use of differential equation models requires software that is easy to
test and flexible for setting up extensive numerical experiments.
This section introduces three important concepts and their applications
to the exponential decay model:

  * Modules

  * Testing frameworks

  * Implementation with classes

.. _decay:prog:se:module:

Making a module
---------------


.. index:: modules (Python)


The previous sections has outlined numerous different programs, all of
them having their own copy of the ``solver`` function.  Such copies
of the same piece of code is against the important *Don't Repeat
Yourself* (DRY) principle in programming.  If we want to change the
``solver`` function there should be one and only one place where the
change needs to be performed.

To clean up the repetitive code snippets scattered among the
``dc_*.py`` files, we start by collecting the
various functions we want to keep for the future in one file,
now called `dc_mod.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/dc_mod.py>`_.
The following functions are copied to this file:

 * ``solver``

 * ``verify_three_steps``

 * ``verify_discrete_solution``

 * ``explore``

 * ``define_command_line_options``

 * ``read_command_line`` extended to work both with ``sys.argv`` directly
   and with an ``ArgumentParser`` object

 * ``main`` (with convergence rates estimation as in ``dc_convrate.py``)

 * ``verify_convergence_rate``

We use Matplotlib for plotting. A sketch of the ``dc_mod.py``
file, with complete versions of the modified functions, looks as follows:


.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import *
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *
        import sys
        
        def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
            ...
        
        def verify_three_steps():
            ...
        
        def verify_exact_discrete_solution():
            ...
        
        def exact_solution(t, I, a):
            ...
        
        def explore(I, a, T, dt, theta=0.5, makeplot=True):
            ...
        
        def define_command_line_options():
            ...
        
        def read_command_line(use_argparse=True):
            if use_argparse:
                parser = define_command_line_options()
                args = parser.parse_args()
                print 'I={}, a={}, makeplot={}, dt_values={}'.format(
                    args.I, args.a, args.makeplot, args.dt_values)
                return args.I, args.a, args.makeplot, args.dt_values
            else:
                if len(sys.argv) < 6:
                    print 'Usage: %s I a on/off dt1 dt2 dt3 ...' % \
                          sys.argv[0]; sys.exit(1)
        
                I = float(sys.argv[1])
                a = float(sys.argv[2])
                T = float(sys.argv[3])
                makeplot = sys.argv[4] in ('on', 'True')
                dt_values = [float(arg) for arg in sys.argv[5:]]
        
                return I, a, makeplot, dt_values
        
        def main():
            ...


This ``dc_mod.py`` file is already a module such that we can import
desired in functions in other programs. For example,


.. code-block:: python

        from decay_theta import solver
        u, t = solver(I=1.0, a=3.0, T=3, dt=0.01, theta=0.5)



.. index:: test block (Python modules)


However, it should also be possible to both use ``dc_mod.py`` as
a module *and* execute the file as a program that runs ``main()``. This is
accomplished by ending the file with a *test block*:


.. code-block:: python

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            main()

When ``dc_mod.py`` is used as a module, ``__name__`` equals the module
name ``decay_theta``, while ``__name__`` equals ``'__main__'`` when the
file is run as a program.
Optionally, we could run the verification tests if the word ``verify``
is present on the command line and ``verify_convergence_rate`` could
be tested if ``verify_rates`` is found on the command line. The
``verify_rates`` argument must be removed before we read parameter values from
the command line, other wise ``read_command_line`` (called by ``main``)
will not work properly.


.. code-block:: python

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            if 'verify' in sys.argv:
                if verify_three_steps() and verify_discrete_solution():
                    pass # ok
                else:
                    print 'Bug in the implementation!'
            elif 'verify_rates' in sys.argv:
                sys.argv.remove('verify_rates')
                if not '--dt' in sys.argv:
                    print 'Must assign several dt values'
                    sys.exit(1)  # abort
                if verify_convergence_rate():
                    pass
                else:
                    print 'Bug in the implementation!'
            else:
                # Perform simulations
                main()


.. _decay:prog:se:import:

Prefixing imported functions by the module name
-----------------------------------------------


.. index:: module import


Import statements of the form ``from module import *`` imports
functions and variables in ``module.py`` into the current file.
For example, when doing


.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import *
        from matplotlib.pyplot import *

we get mathematical functions like ``sin`` and ``exp``
as well as MATLAB-style functions like ``linspace`` and ``plot``,
which can be called by these well-known names.
However, it sometimes becomes confusing to
know where a particular function comes from. Is it from ``numpy``? Or
``matplotlib.pyplot``?
Or is it our own function?

An alternative import is


.. code-block:: python

        import numpy
        import matplotlib.pyplot

and such imports require functions to be prefixed by the module name, e.g.,


.. code-block:: python

        t = numpy.linspace(0, T, N+1)
        u_e = I*numpy.exp(-a*t)
        matplotlib.pyplot.plot(t, u_e)

This is normally regarded as a better habit because it is explicitly stated
from which module a function comes from.

The modules ``numpy`` and ``matplotlib.pyplot`` are so frequently used,
and their full names quite tedious to write, so two standard abbreviations
have evolved in the Python scientific computing community:


.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        
        t = np.linspace(0, T, N+1)
        u_e = I*np.exp(-a*t)
        plt.plot(t, u_e)

A version of the ``decay_theta`` module where we use the ``np`` and ``plt``
prefixes is found in the file
`decay_theta_v2.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/decay_theta_v2.py>`_.

The downside of prefixing functions by the module name is that
mathematical expressions like :math:`e^{-at}\sin(2\pi t)` gets
cluttered with module names,

.. code-block:: python

        numpy.exp(-a*t)*numpy.sin(2(numpy.pi*t)
        # or
        np.exp(-a*t)*np.sin(2*np.pi*t)

Such an expression looks like ``exp(-a*t)*sin(2*pi*t)`` in most
other programming languages. Similarly,
``np.linspace`` and ``plt.plot`` look less familiar to people who are
used to MATLAB and who have not adopted Python's prefix style.
Whether to do ``from module import *`` or ``import module`` depends
on personal taste and the problem at hand. In these writings we use
``from module import`` in shorter programs where similarity with
MATLAB could be an advantage, and where a one-to-one correspondence between
mathematical formulas and Python expressions is important.
The style ``import module`` is preferred inside Python modules (see
:ref:`decay:exer:module1` for a demonstration).

We have emphasized how important it is to be able to run tests in the
program at any time. This was solved by calling various ``verify*``
functions in the previous examples. However, there exists
well-established procedures and corresponding tools for automating
checking of tests. We shall briefly demonstrate two important
techniques: *doctest* and *unit testing*. The corresponding files are
the modules `dc_mod_doctest.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/dc_mod_doctest.py>`_
and `dc_mod_unittest.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/dc_mod_unittest.py>`_.


Doc strings (the first string after the function header) are used to
document the purpose of functions and their arguments. Very often it
is instructive to include an example on how to use the function.
Interactive examples in the Python shell are most illustrative as
we can see the output resulting from function calls. For example,
we can in the ``solver`` function include an example on calling
this function and printing the computed ``u`` and ``t`` arrays:


.. code-block:: python

        def solver(I, a, T, dt, theta):
            """
            Solve u'=-a*u, u(0)=I, for t in (0,T] with steps of dt.
        
        
            >>> u, t = solver(I=0.8, a=1.2, T=4, dt=0.5, theta=0.5)
            >>> for t_n, u_n in zip(t, u):
            ...     print 't=%.1f, u=%.14f' % (t_n, u_n)
            t=0.0, u=0.80000000000000
            t=0.5, u=0.43076923076923
            t=1.0, u=0.23195266272189

            """
            ...


When such interactive demonstrations are inserted in doc strings,
Python's `doctest <http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html>`_
module can be used to automate running all commands
in interactive sessions and compare new output with the output
appearing in the doc string.  All we have to do in the current example
is to write


.. code-block:: python

        Terminal> python -m doctest dc_mod_doctest.py

This command imports the ``doctest`` module, which runs all tests.
No additional command-line argument is allowed when running doctest.
If any test fails, the problem is reported, e.g.,


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python -m doctest dc_mod_doctest.py

Note that in the output of ``t`` and ``u`` we write ``u`` with 14 digits.
Writing all 16 digits is not a good idea: if the tests are run on
different hardware, round-off errors might be different, and
the ``doctest`` module detects numbers are not precisely the same
and reports failures. In the present application, where :math:`0 < u(t) \leq 0.8`,
we expect round-off errors to be of size :math:`10^{-16}`, so comparing 15
digits would probably be reliable, but we compare 14 to be on the
safe side.

Doctests are highly encouraged as they do two things: 1) demonstrate
how a function is used and 2) test that the function works.

Here is an example on a doctest in the ``explore`` function:


.. code-block:: python

        def explore(I, a, T, dt, theta=0.5, makeplot=True):
            """
            Run a case with the solver, compute error measure,
            and plot the numerical and exact solutions (if makeplot=True).
        
            >>> for theta in 0, 0.5, 1:
            ...    E = explore(I=1.9, a=2.1, T=5, dt=0.1, theta=theta,
            ...                makeplot=False)
            ...    print '%.10E' % E
            ...
            7.3565079236E-02
            2.4183893110E-03
            6.5013039886E-02
            """
            ...

This time we limit the output to 10 digits.

We remark that doctests are not straightforward to construct for
functions that rely on command-line input and that print results to
the terminal window.

.. _decay:prog:se:nose:

Unit testing with nose
----------------------


.. index:: nose (testing)


.. index:: unit testing


.. index::
   single: software testing; nose


The unit testing technique consists of identifying small units
of code, usually functions (or classes), and write one or more tests for
each unit. One test should, ideally, not depend on the outcome of
other tests. For example, the doctest in function ``solver`` is a
unit test, and the doctest in function ``explore`` as well, but the
latter depends on a working ``solver``. Putting the error computation
and plotting in ``explore`` in two separate functions would allow
independent unit tests. In this way, the design of unit tests impacts
the design of functions. The recommended practice is actually to
design and write the unit tests first and *then* implement the functions!

In scientific computing it is still not obvious how to best perform
unit testing. The units is naturally larger than in non-scientific
software. Very often the solution procedure of a mathematical problem
identifies a unit.

Basic use of nose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``nose`` package is a versatile tool for implementing unit tests
in Python. Here is a recommended way of structuring tests:

 1. Implement tests in functions with names starting with ``test_``.

 2. Test functions perform assertions on computed results
    using ``assert`` functions from the ``nose.tools`` module.

 3. Test functions can be in the source code files or be
    collected in separate files, usually with names starting with ``test_``.

Here comes a very simple illustration of the three points.
Assume that we have this function in a module ``mymod``:


.. code-block:: python

        def double(n):
            return 2*n


Either in this file or in a separate file ``test_mymod.py``, we
implement a test function whose purpose is
to test that the function ``double`` works as intended:


.. code-block:: python

        import nose.tools as nt
        
        def test_double():
            result = mymod.double(4)
            nt.assert_equal(result, 8)

We need to do an ``import mymod`` if this test is in a separate file, and
Python needs to be able to find ``mymod``.

Running


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> nosetests

makes the ``nose`` tool look for Python files with ``test_*()``
functions and run these functions. If the ``nt.assert_equal`` function
finds that the two arguments are equal, the test is a success, otherwise
it is a failure and an exception of type ``AssertionError`` is raised.
Instead of calling the convenience function ``nt.assert_equal``, we
can use Python's ``assert`` statement, which tests if a boolean
expression is true and raises an ``AssertionError`` if the expression is
false. Here, the statement is ``assert result == 8``.
A completely manual alternative is to write


.. code-block:: python

        if result != 8:
            raise AssertionError()



The number of failed tests and their details are
reported, or an ``OK`` is printed if all tests passed.
Imports like ``import mymod`` in ``test_*.py`` files works even if ``mymod.py``
is not located in the same directory as the test file (``nose`` will
find it without any need for manipulating ``PYTHONPATH`` or ``sys.path``).

The advantage with the ``nose`` is two-fold: 1) tests are written and collected
in a structured way, and 2) large collections of tests, scattered
throughout a tree of folders, can be executed with one command (``nosetests``).

Demonstrating nose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us illustrate how to use the ``nose`` tool for testing key functions
in the ``decay_theta`` module. Or more precisely, the module is called
``decay_theta_unittest`` with all the ``verify*`` functions removed
as these now are outdated by the unit tests.

We design three unit tests:

 1. A comparison between the computed :math:`u^n` values and the
    exact discrete solution.

 2. A comparison between the computed :math:`u^n` values and precomputed,
    verified reference values.

 3. A comparison between observed and expected convergence rates.

These tests follow very closely the code in the previously shown
``verify*`` functions. We start with comparing :math:`u^n`, as computed by
the function ``solver``, to the formula
for the exact discrete solution:


.. code-block:: python

        import nose.tools as nt
        import sys, os
        sys.path.insert(0, os.pardir)
        import dc_mod_unittest as dc_mod
        import numpy as np
        
        def exact_discrete_solution(n, I, a, theta, dt):
            """Return exact discrete solution of the theta scheme."""
            dt = float(dt)  # avoid integer division
            factor = (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)/(1 + theta*dt*a)
            return I*factor**n
        
        def test_against_discrete_solution():
            """
            Compare result from solver against
            formula for the discrete solution.
            """
            theta = 0.8; a = 2; I = 0.1; dt = 0.8
            N = int(8/dt)  # no of steps
            u, t = dc_mod.solver(I=I, a=a, T=N*dt, dt=dt, theta=theta)
            u_de = np.array([exact_discrete_solution(n, I, a, theta, dt)
                             for n in range(N+1)])
            diff = np.abs(u_de - u).max()
            nt.assert_almost_equal(diff, 0, delta=1E-14)


The ``nt.assert_almost_equal`` is the relevant function for comparing two
real numbers. The ``delta`` argument specifies a tolerance for the
comparison. Alternatively, one can specify a ``places`` argument
for the number of decimal places to enter the comparison.

When we at some point have carefully verified the implementation, we may
store correctly computed numbers in the test program or in files for
use in future tests. Here is an example on how the outcome from the
``solver`` function can be compared to what is considered to be
correct results:


.. code-block:: python

        def test_solver():
            """
            Compare result from solver against
            precomputed arrays for theta=0, 0.5, 1.
            """
            I=0.8; a=1.2; T=4; dt=0.5  # fixed parameters
            precomputed = {
                't': np.array([ 0. ,  0.5,  1. ,  1.5,  2. ,  2.5,
                                3. ,  3.5,  4. ]),
                0.5: np.array(
                    [ 0.8       ,  0.43076923,  0.23195266, 0.12489759,

                      0.00565363]),
                0: np.array(
                    [  8.00000000e-01,   3.20000000e-01,
                       1.28000000e-01,   5.12000000e-02,

                1: np.array(
                    [ 0.8       ,  0.5       ,  0.3125    ,  0.1953125 ,
                      0.12207031,  0.07629395,  0.04768372,  0.02980232,
                      0.01862645]),
                }
            for theta in 0, 0.5, 1:
                u, t = dc_mod.solver(I, a, T, dt, theta=theta)
                diff = np.abs(u - precomputed[theta]).max()
                # Precomputed numbers are known to 8 decimal places
                nt.assert_almost_equal(diff, 0, places=8,
                                       msg='theta=%s' % theta)

The ``precomputed`` object is a dictionary with four keys: ``'t'`` for the
time mesh, and three :math:`\theta` values for :math:`u^n` solutions corresponding
to the :math:`\theta=0,0.5,1`.

Testing for special type of input data that may cause trouble constitutes
a common way of constructing unit tests. The updating formula for
:math:`u^{n+1}` may be incorrectly evaluated because of unintended integer
divisions. For example, with

.. code-block:: python

        theta = 1; a = 1; I = 1; dt = 2

the nominator and denominator in the updating expression,

.. code-block:: python

        (1 - (1-theta)*a*dt)
        (1 + theta*dt*a)

evaluate to 1 and 3, respectively, and the fraction ``1/3`` will
call up integer division and consequently lead to ``u[n+1]=0``.
We construct a unit test to make sure ``solver`` is smart
enough to avoid this problem:


.. code-block:: python

        def test_potential_integer_division():
            """Choose variables that can trigger integer division."""
            theta = 1; a = 1; I = 1; dt = 2
            N = 4
            u, t = dc_mod.solver(I=I, a=a, T=N*dt, dt=dt, theta=theta)
            u_de = np.array([exact_discrete_solution(n, I, a, theta, dt)
                             for n in range(N+1)])
            diff = np.abs(u_de - u).max()
            nt.assert_almost_equal(diff, 0, delta=1E-14)


The final test is to see if :math:`\theta=0,1` has convergence rate 1 and
:math:`\theta=0.5` has convergence rate 2:


.. code-block:: python

        def test_convergence_rates():
            """Compare empirical convergence rates to exact ones."""
            # Set command-line arguments directly in sys.argv
            sys.argv[1:] = '--I 0.8 --a 2.1 --T 5 '\ 
                           '--dt 0.4 0.2 0.1 0.05 0.025'.split()
            # Suppress output from dc_mod.main()
            stdout = sys.stdout  # save standard output for later use
            scratchfile = open('.tmp', 'w')  # fake standard output
            sys.stdout = scratchfile
        
            r = dc_mod.main()
            for theta in r:
                nt.assert_true(r[theta])  # check for non-empty list
        
            scratchfile.close()
            sys.stdout = stdout  # restore standard output
        
            expected_rates = {0: 1, 1: 1, 0.5: 2}
            for theta in r:
                r_final = r[theta][-1]
                # Compare to 1 decimal place
                nt.assert_almost_equal(expected_rates[theta], r_final,
                                       places=1, msg='theta=%s' % theta)
        
        # no need for any main


Nothing more is needed in the `test_dc_nose.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/test/test_dc_nose.py>`_.
file. Running ``nosetests`` will report ``Ran 3 tests`` and an ``OK`` for
success.  Everytime we modify the ``decay_theta_unittest`` module we can
run ``nosetests`` to quickly see if the edits have any impact on the
test collection.

Installation of nose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``nose`` does not come with a standard Python distribution and must
therefore be installed separately. The procedure is standard and
described on `Nose's web pages <http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.  On Debian-based Linux
systems the command is ``sudo apt-get install python-nose``, and
with MacPorts you run ``sudo port install py27-nose``.


.. index:: nose testing of doctests


.. index::
   single: software testing; nose w/doctests


Using nose to test modules with doctests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assume that ``mod`` is the name of some module that contains doctests.
We may let ``nose`` run these doctests and report errors in the
standard way using the code set-up


.. code-block:: python

        import doctest
        import mod
        
        def test_mod():
            failure_count, test_count = doctest.testmod(m=mod)
            nt.assert_equal(failure_count, 0,
                            msg='%d tests out of %d failed' %
                            (failure_count, test_count))

The call to ``doctest.testmod`` runs all doctests in the module file
``mod.py`` and returns the number of failures (``failure_count``)
and the total number of tests (``test_count``). A real example is
found in the file
`test_dc_doctest.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/test/test_dc_doctest.py>`_.


.. _decay:prog:se:unittest:

Classical unit testing with unittest
------------------------------------


.. index:: unit testing


.. index:: unittest


.. index::
   single: software testing; unittest


The classical way of implementing unit tests derives from the JUnit
tool in Java where all tests are methods in a class for testing.
Python comes with a module ``unittest`` for doing this type of unit tests.
While ``nose`` allows simple functions for unit tests, ``unittest``
requires deriving a class ``Test*`` from ``unittest.TestCase`` and
implementing each test as methods with names ``test_*`` in that class.

Basic use of unittest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. index:: unittest

.. index:: TestCase (class in unittest)


Using the ``double`` function in the ``mymod`` module introduced in the
previous section, unit testing with the aid of the ``unittest`` module
consists of writing a file ``test_mymod.py`` with the content

        import unittest
        import mymod
        
        class TestMyCode(unittest.TestCase):

The test is run by executing the test file ``test_mymod.py`` as a standard
Python program. There is no support in ``unittest`` for automatically
locating and running all tests in all test files in a folder tree.

Those who have experience with object-oriented programming will see that
the difference between using ``unittest`` and ``nose`` is minor.
Programmers with no or little knowledge of classes will certainly
prefer ``nose``.

Demonstration of unittest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The same tests as shown for the nose framework are reimplemented
with the ``TestCase`` classes in the file `test_dc_unittest.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/test/test_dc_nose.py>`_.
The tests are identical, the only difference being that with
``unittest`` we must write the tests as methods in
a class and the assert functions have
slightly different syntax.

Implementing simple problem and solver classes
----------------------------------------------

The :math:`\theta`-rule was compactly and conveniently implemented in
a function ``solver``. In more complicated problems it might
be beneficial to use classes and introduce a class ``Problem`` to
hold the definition of the physical problem, a class ``Solver``
to hold the data and methods needed to numerically solve the problem,
and a class ``Visualizer`` to make plots.
This idea will now be illustrated, resulting in code that represents
an alternative to the ``solver`` and ``explore`` functions found
in the ``dc_mod`` module.

Explaining the details of class programming in Python
is considered beyond the scope of this text.
Readers who are unfamiliar with Python class programming
should first consult one of the many electronic Python tutorials
or textbooks to come up to speed with concepts and syntax of
Python classes before reading on.

The problem class  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. index:: problem class


The purpose of the problem class is to store all information about
the mathematical model. This usually means all the physical parameters
in the problem. In the current example with exponential decay we may
also add the exact solution of the ODE to the problem class.
The simplest form of a problem class is therefore


.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import exp
        
        class Problem:
            def __init__(self, I=1, a=1, T=10):
                self.T, self.I, self.a = I, float(a), T
        
            def exact_solution(self, t):
                I, a = self.I, self.a
                return I*exp(-a*t)

We could in the ``exact_solution`` method have written
``self.I*exp(-self.a*t)``, but using local variables ``I`` and ``a`` allows
a formula ``I*exp(-a*t)`` which looks closer to the mathematical
expression :math:`Ie^{-at}`.  This is not an important issue with the
current compact formula, but is beneficial in more complicated
problems with longer formulas to obtain the closest possible
relationship between code and mathematics. Python class
programming by this author is therefore
recognized by "stripping off" the ``self`` prefix in variables that
enter mathematical formulas.

The class data can be set either as arguments in the constructor or
at any time later, e.g.,


.. code-block:: python

        problem = Problem(T=5)
        problem.T = 8
        problem.dt = 1.5

However, it would be convenient if class ``Problem`` could also initialize
the data from the command line. To this end, we add a method for
defining a set of command-line options and a method that sets the
local attributes equal to what was found on the command line.
The default values associated with the command-line options are taken
as the values provided to the constructor. Class ``Problem`` now becomes


.. code-block:: python

        class Problem:
            def __init__(self, I=1, a=1, T=10):
                self.T, self.I, self.a = I, float(a), T
        
            def define_command_line_options(self, parser=None):
                if parser is None:
                    import argparse
                    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        
                parser.add_argument(
                    '--I', '--initial_condition', type=float,
                    default=self.I, help='initial condition, u(0)',
                    metavar='I')
                parser.add_argument(
                    '--a', type=float, default=self.a,
                    help='coefficient in ODE', metavar='a')
                parser.add_argument(
                    '--T', '--stop_time', type=float, default=self.T,
                    help='end time of simulation', metavar='T')
                return parser
        
            def init_from_command_line(self, args):
                self.I, self.a, self.T = args.I, args.a, args.T
        
            def exact_solution(self, t):
                I, a = self.I, self.a
                return I*exp(-a*t)

Observe that if the user already has an ``ArgumentParser`` object it can be
supplied, but if we do not have, class ``Problem`` makes one for us.
Python's ``None`` object is used to indicate that a variable is not
initialized with a value.

The solver class  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. index:: solver class


The solver class stores data related to the numerical solution method
and provides a function ``solve`` for solving the problem.
A problem object must be given to the constructor so that the solver
can easily look up physical data. In the present example, the
data related to the numerical solution method consist of :math:`\Delta t`
and :math:`\theta`. We add, as in the problem class, functionality for
reading :math:`\Delta t` and :math:`\theta` from the command line:


.. code-block:: python

        class Solver:
            def __init__(self, problem, dt=0.1, theta=0.5):
                self.problem = problem
                self.dt, self.theta = float(dt), theta
        
            def define_command_line_options(self, parser):
                parser.add_argument(
                    '--dt', '--time_step_value', type=float,
                    default=0.5, help='time step value', metavar='dt')
                parser.add_argument(
                    '--theta', type=float, default=0.5,
                    help='time discretization parameter', metavar='dt')
                return parser
        
            def init_from_command_line(self, args):
                self.dt, self.theta = args.dt, args.theta
        
            def solve(self):
                from dc_mod import solver
                self.u, self.t = solver(
                    self.problem.I, self.problem.a, self.problem.T,
                    self.dt, self.theta)
        
            def error(self):
                u_e = self.problem.exact_solution(self.t)
                e = u_e - self.u
                E = sqrt(self.dt*sum(e**2))
                return E

Note that we here simply reuse the implementation of the numerical method
from the ``dc_mod`` module.

The visualizer class  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. index:: visualizer class


The purpose of the visualizer class is to plot the numerical solution
stored in class ``Solver``. We also add the possibility to plot the
exact solution. Access to the problem and solver objects is required
when making plots so the constructor must store these objects:


.. code-block:: python

        class Visualizer:
            def __init__(self, problem, solver):
                self.problem, self.solver = problem, solver
        
            def plot(self, include_exact=True, plt=None):
                """
                Add solver.u curve to scitools plotting object plt,
                and include the exact solution if include_exact is True.
                This plot function can be called several times (if
                the solver object has computed new solutions).
                """
                if plt is None:
                    import scitools.std
                    plt = scitools.std
        
                plt.plot(self.solver.t, self.solver.u, '--o')
                plt.hold('on')
                theta2name = {0: 'FE', 1: 'BE', 0.5: 'CN'}
                name = self.solver.theta2name.get(self.solver.theta, '')
                plt.legend('numerical %s' % name)
                if include_exact:
                    t_e = linspace(0, self.problem.T, 1001)
                    u_e = self.problem.exact_solution(t_e)
                    plt.plot(t_e, u_e, 'b-')
                    plt.legend('exact')
                plt.xlabel('t')
                plt.ylabel('u')
                plt.title('theta=%g, dt=%g' %
                          (self.solver.theta, self.solver.dt))
                plt.savefig('%s_%g.png' % (name, self.solver.dt))
                return plt


The ``plt`` object in the ``plot`` method is worth a comment. The idea is
that ``plot`` can add a numerical solution curve to an existing
plot. Calling ``plot`` with a ``plt`` object, which has to be a
``scitools.std`` object in this implementation, will just add the curve
``self.solver.u`` as a dashed line with circles at the mesh points
(leaving the color of the curve up to the plotting tool). This
functionality allows plots with several solutions: just make a loop
where new data is set in the problem and/or solver classes, the
solver's ``solve()`` method is called, the most recent numerical
solution is plotted by the ``plot(plt)`` method in the visualizer object
(:ref:`decay:exer:dc_class:exper` describes a problem setting
where this functionality is explored).

Combing the objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eventually we need to show how the classes ``Problem``, ``Solver``, and
``Visualizer`` play together:


.. code-block:: python

        def main():
            problem = Problem()
            solver = Solver(problem)
            viz = Visualizer(problem, solver)
        
            # Read input from the command line
            parser = problem.define_command_line_options()
            parser = solver. define_command_line_options(parser)
            args = parser.parse_args()
            problem.init_from_command_line(args)
            solver. init_from_command_line(args)
        
            # Solve and plot
            solver.solve()
            plt = viz.plot()
            E = solver.error()
            if E is not None:
                print 'Error: %.4E' % E
            plt.show()


The file `dc_class.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/dc_class.py>`_
constitutes a module with the three classes and the ``main`` function.


.. _decay:prog:se:class2:

Implementing more advanced problem and solver classes
-----------------------------------------------------

The previous ``Problem`` and ``Solver`` classes containing parameters
soon get much repetitive code when the number of parameters increases.
Much of this code can be parameterized and be made more compact.
For this purpose, we decide to collect all parameters in a dictionary,
``self.prms``, with two associated dictionaries ``self.types`` and
``self.help`` for holding associated object types and help strings.
Provided a problem, solver, or visualizer class defines these three
dictionaries in the constructor, using default or user-supplied values
of the parameters, we can create a super class ``Parameters`` with general code
for defining command-line options and reading them as well as
methods for setting and getting a parameter. A ``Problem`` or ``Solver`` class will
then inherit command-line functionality and the set/get methods from
the ``Parameters`` class.

A generic class for parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A simplified version of the parameter class looks as follows:


.. code-block:: python

        class Parameters:
            def set(self, **parameters):
                for name in parameters:
                    self.prms[name] = parameters[name]
        
            def get(self, name):
                return self.prms[name]
        
            def define_command_line_options(self, parser=None):
                if parser is None:
                    import argparse
                    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        
                for name in self.prms:
                    tp = self.types[name] if name in self.types else str
                    help = self.help[name] if name in self.help else None
                    parser.add_argument(
                        '--' + name, default=self.get(name), metavar=name,
                        type=tp, help=help)
        
                return parser
        
            def init_from_command_line(self, args):
                for name in self.prms:
                    self.prms[name] = getattr(args, name)

The file `class_dc_verf1.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/class_dc_verf1.py>`_ contains
a slightly more advanced version of class ``Parameters`` where we
in the ``set`` and ``get`` functions test for valid parameter names and
raise exceptions with informative messages if any name is not registered.

The problem class  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. index:: problem class


A class ``Problem`` for the exponential decay ODE with parameters :math:`a`, :math:`I`, and
:math:`T` can now be coded as


.. code-block:: python

        class Problem(Parameters):
            """
            Physical parameters for the problem u'=-a*u, u(0)=I,
            with t in [0,T].
            """
            def __init__(self):
                self.prms = dict(I=1, a=1, T=10)
                self.types = dict(I=float, a=float, T=float)
                self.help = dict(I='initial condition, u(0)',
                                 a='coefficient in ODE',
                                 T='end time of simulation')
        
            def exact_solution(self, t):
                I, a = self.get('I'), self.get('a')
                return I*np.exp(-a*t)


The solver class  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. index:: solver class


Also the solver class is derived from class ``Parameters`` and works with
the ``prms``, ``types``, and ``help`` dictionaries in the same way as class
``Problem``. Otherwise, the code is very similar to class ``Solver`` in
the ``decay_class.py`` file:


.. code-block:: python

        class Solver(Parameters):
            def __init__(self, problem):
                self.problem = problem
                self.prms = dict(dt=0.5, theta=0.5)
                self.types = dict(dt=float, theta=float)
                self.help = dict(dt='time step value',
                                 theta='time discretization parameter')
        
            def solve(self):
                #from dc_mod import solver
                from decay_theta import solver
                self.u, self.t = solver(
                    self.problem.get('I'),
                    self.problem.get('a'),
                    self.problem.get('T'),
                    self.get('dt'),
                    self.get('theta'))
        
            def error(self):
                try:
                    u_e = self.problem.exact_solution(self.t)
                    e = u_e - self.u
                    E = np.sqrt(self.get('dt')*np.sum(e**2))
                except AttributeError:
                    E = None
                return E


The visualizer class  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. index:: visualizer class


Class ``Visualizer`` can be identical to the one in the ``decay_class.py`` file
since the class does not need any parameters. However, a few
adjustments in the ``plot`` method is necessary since parameters are
accessed as, e.g., ``problem.get('T')`` rather than ``problem.T``.
The details are found in the file `class_dc_verf1.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/class_dc_verf1.py>`_.

Finally, we need a function that solves a real problem using the
classes ``Problem``, ``Solver``, and ``Visualizer``. This function can
be just like ``main`` in the ``class_dc_v1.py`` file.

The advantage with the ``Parameters`` class is that it scales to problems
with a large number of physical and numerical parameters:
as long as the parameters are defined once via a dictionary,
the compact code in class ``Parameters`` can handle any collection of
parameters of any size.


.. _decay:experiments:

Performing scientific experiments
=================================


.. index:: numerical experiments

.. index:: scientific experiments


The goal of this section is to explore the behavior of a numerical
method for a differential equation and show how scientific experiments
can be set up and reported. We address the ODE problem


.. math::
   :label: decay:experiments:model
        
        u'(t) = -au(t),\quad u(0)=I,\quad 0<t\leq T,
        
        

numerically discretized by the :math:`\theta`-rule:


.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n,
        \quad u^0=I\thinspace .
        

Our aim is to plot :math:`u^n` against the exact solution :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}} = Ie^{-at}`
for various choices of the parameters in this numerical problem:
:math:`I`, :math:`a`, :math:`\Delta t`, and :math:`\theta`. In particular, we are interested
in how the discrete solution compares with the exact solution
when the :math:`\Delta t` parameter is varied and :math:`\theta` takes on the three values
corresponding to the Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and Crank-Nicolson
schemes (:math:`\theta=0,1,0.5`, respectively).

A verified implementation for computing :math:`u^n` and plotting :math:`u^n` together
with :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}` is found in the file
`dc_mod.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/dc_mod.py>`_.
This program admits command-line arguments to specify a series of
:math:`\Delta t` values and will run a loop over these values and
:math:`\theta=0,0.5,1`. We make a slight edit of how the plots are
designed: the numerical solution is specified with line type ``'r--o'``
(dashed red lines with dots at the mesh points), and the ``show()``
command is removed to avoid a lot of plot windows popping up on
the computer screen (but hardcopies of the plot are still stored
in files via ``savefig``). The slightly
modified program has the name
`experiments/dc_mod.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/experiments/dc_mod.py>`_.
All files associated with the scientific investigation are collected
in a subfolder ``experiments``.

Running the experiments is easy since the ``dc_mod.py`` program
already has the loops over :math:`\theta` and :math:`\Delta t` implemented:


.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python dc_mod.py --I 1 --a 2 --makeplot \
                  --T 5 --dt 0.5 0.25 0.1 0.05


The ``dc_mod.py`` program generates a lot of image files, e.g.,
``FE_*.png``, ``BE_*.png``, and ``CN_*.png``.
We want to combine all the ``FE_*.png`` files in a table
fashion in one file, with two images in each row,
starting with the largest :math:`\Delta t` in the upper
left corner and decreasing the value as we go to the right and down.
This can be done using the `montage <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/montage.php>`_ program. The often occurring white areas around the plots can
be cropped away by the ``convert -trim`` command.

Also plot files in the PDF format with names ``FE_*.pdf``, ``BE_*.pdf``,
and ``CN_*.pdf`` are generated and these should be combined using other
tools: ``pdftk`` to combine individual plots into one file with one plot
per page, and ``pdfnup`` to combine the pages into a table with multiple
plots per page. The resulting image often has some extra surrounding
white space that can be removed by the ``pdfcrop`` program.
The code snippets below contains all details about the
usage of ``montage``, ``convert``, ``pdftk``, ``pdfnup``, and ``pdfcrop``.



.. index:: script


Running manual commands is boring, and errors may easily
sneak in. Both for automating manual work and documenting the
operating system commands we actually issued in the experiment,
we should write a *script* (little program). The script takes
a list of :math:`\Delta t` values on the command line as input and
makes three combined images, one for each :math:`\theta` value,
displaying the quality of the numerical solution as :math:`\Delta t`
varies. For example,

.. code-block:: console

        Terminal> python dc_exper0.py 0.5 0.25 0.1 0.05

results in images ``FE.png``, ``CN.png``, ``BE.png``,
``FE.pdf``, ``CN.pdf``, and ``BE.pdf``,
each with four plots corresponding to the four :math:`\Delta t` values.
Each plot compares the numerical solution with the exact one.
The latter image is shown in Figure :ref:`decay:experiments:fig:BE4a`.


.. _decay:experiments:fig:BE4a:

   *Illustration of the Backward Euler method for four time step values*


Ideally, the script should be scalable in the sense that it works for
any number of :math:`\Delta t` values, which is the case for this particular
implementation:


.. code-block:: python

        import os, sys
        
        # The command line must contain dt values
        if len(sys.argv) > 1:
            dt_values = [float(arg) for arg in sys.argv[1:]]
        else:
            print 'Usage: %s dt1 dt2 dt3 ...';  sys.exit(1)  # abort
        
        # Fixed physical parameters
        I = 1
        a = 2
        T = 5
        
        # Run module file as a stand-alone application
        cmd = 'python dc_mod.py --I %g --a %g --makeplot --T %g' % \
              (I, a, T)
        dt_values_str = ' '.join([str(v) for v in dt_values])
        cmd += ' --dt %s' % dt_values_str
        print cmd
        failure = os.system(cmd)
        if failure:
            print 'Command failed:', cmd; sys.exit(1)
        
        # Combine images into rows with 2 plots in each row
        combine_image_commands = []
        for method in 'BE', 'CN', 'FE':
            imagefiles = ' '.join(['%s_%s.pdf' % (method, dt)
                                   for dt in dt_values])
            combine_image_commands.append(
                'montage -background white -geometry 100%' + \
                ' -tile 2x %s %s.png' % (imagefiles, method))
            combine_image_commands.append(
                'convert -trim %s.png %s.png' % (method, method))
            combine_image_commands.append(
                'pdftk %s output tmp.pdf' % imagefiles)
            num_rows = int(round(len(dt_values)/2.0))
            combine_image_commands.append(
                'pdfnup --nup 2x%d tmp.pdf' % num_rows)
            combine_image_commands.append(
                'pdfcrop tmp-nup.pdf')
            combine_image_commands.append(
                'mv -f tmp-nup-crop.pdf %s.pdf;'
                'rm -f tmp.pdf tmp-nup.pdf' % method)
            imagefiles = ' '.join(['%s_%s.png' % (method, dt)
                                   for dt in dt_values])
        
        for cmd in combine_image_commands:
            print cmd
            failure = os.system(cmd)
            if failure:
                print 'Command failed:', cmd; sys.exit(1)
        
        # Remove the files generated by dc_mod.py
        from glob import glob
        filenames = glob('*_*.png') + glob('*_*.pdf') + glob('*_*.eps')  +\
                    glob('tmp*.pdf')
        for filename in filenames:
            os.remove(filename)

This file is available as `experiments/dc_exper0.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/experiments/dc_exper0.py>`_.


.. index:: Unix wildcard notation


.. index:: os.system


We may comment upon many useful constructs in this script:

 * ``[float(arg) for arg in sys.argv[1:]]`` builds a list of real numbers
   from all the command-line arguments.

 * ``failure = os.system(cmd)`` runs an operating system command, e.g.,
   another program. The execution successful only if ``failure`` is zero.

 * Unsuccessful execution usually makes it meaningless to continue
   the program, and therefore we abort the program with ``sys.exit(1)``.
   Any argument different from 0 signifies that our program stopped
   with a failure.

 * ``['%s_%s.png' % (method, dt) for dt in dt_values]`` builds a list of
   filenames from a list of numbers (``dt_values``).

 * All ``montage``, ``pdftk``, ``pdfnup``, and ``mv`` commands for creating
   composite figures are stored in a
   list and later executed in a loop.

 * ``glob('*_*.png')`` returns a list of the names of all files in the
   current folder where the filename matches the *Unix wildcard notation*
   ``*_*.png`` (meaning "any text, underscore, any text, and then `.png`").

 * ``os.remove(filename)`` removes the file with name ``filename``.

Interpreting output from other programs
---------------------------------------

Programs that run other programs, like ``dc_exper0.py`` does, will often
need to interpret output from the other programs. Let us demonstrate how
this is done in Python by extracting the relations between :math:`\theta`,
:math:`\Delta t`, and the error :math:`E` as written to the terminal window
by the ``dc_mod.py`` program, which is being executed by
``dc_exper0.py``. We will

  * read the output from the ``dc_mod.py`` program

  * interpret this output and store the :math:`E` values in arrays for each
    :math:`\theta` value

  * plot :math:`E` versus :math:`\Delta t`, for each :math:`\theta`, in a log-log plot

.. index:: subprocess (Python module)


.. index:: Popen (in subprocess module)


The simple ``os.system(cmd)`` call does not allow us to read the
output from running ``cmd``. Instead we need to invoke a bit more
involved procedure:


.. code-block:: python

        from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUT
        p = Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT)
        output, dummy = p.communicate()
        failure = p.returncode
        if failure:
            print 'Command failed:', cmd; sys.exit(1)

The command stored in ``cmd`` is run and all text that is written to
the standard output *and* the standard error is available in the
string ``output``. The text in ``output`` is what appeared in the
terminal window while running ``cmd``.

Our next task is to run through the ``output`` string, line by line,
and if the current line prints :math:`\theta`, :math:`\Delta t`, and :math:`E`,
we split the line into these three pieces and store the data.
The chosen storage structure is a dictionary ``errors`` with keys ``dt``
to hold the :math:`\Delta t` values, and three :math:`\theta` keys to hold
the corresponding :math:`E` values. The relevant code lines are


.. code-block:: python

        errors = {'dt': dt_values, 1: [], 0: [], 0.5: []}
        for line in output.splitlines():
            words = line.split()
            if words[0] in ('0.0', '0.5', '1.0'):  # line with E?
                # typical line: 0.0   1.25:    7.463E+00
                theta = float(words[0])
                E = float(words[2])
                errors[theta].append(E)

Note that we do not bother to store the :math:`\Delta t` values as we
read them from ``output``, because we already have these values in
the ``dt_values`` list.

We are now ready to plot :math:`E` versus :math:`\Delta t` for :math:`\theta=0,0.5,1`:


.. code-block:: python

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        #import scitools.std as plt
        plt.loglog(errors['dt'], errors[0], 'ro-')
        plt.hold('on')  # MATLAB style...
        plt.loglog(errors['dt'], errors[0.5], 'b+-')
        plt.loglog(errors['dt'], errors[1], 'gx-')
        plt.legend(['FE', 'CN', 'BE'], loc='upper left')
        plt.xlabel('log(time step)')
        plt.ylabel('log(error)')
        plt.title('Error vs time step')
        plt.savefig('error_BE_CN_FE.png')
        plt.savefig('error_BE_CN_FE.pdf')

Plots occasionally need some manual adjustments. Here, the axis of
the log-log plot look nicer if we adapt them strictly to the data,
see Figure :ref:`decay:exper:Evsdt`.
To this end, we need to compute :math:`\min E` and :math:`\max E`, and later
specify the extent of the axes:


.. code-block:: python

        errors = {'dt': dt_values, 1: [], 0: [], 0.5: []}
        min_E = 1E+20; max_E = -min_E  # keep track of min/max E for axis
        for line in output.splitlines():
            ...
                ...
                min_E = min(min_E, E);  max_E = max(max_E, E)
        
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        plt.loglog(errors['dt'], errors[0], 'ro-')
        ...
        plt.axis([min(dt_values), max(dt_values), min_E, max_E])
        ...

The complete program, incorporating the code snippets above, is found
in `experiments/dc_exper1.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/experiments/dc_exper1.py>`_.
This program can hopefully be reused in a number of other occasions
where one needs to run experiments, extract data from the output
of programs, make plots, and combine several plots in a figure file.

.. _decay:exper:report:

Making a report
---------------

The results of running computer experiments are best documented in a
little report containing the problem to be solved, key code segments,
and the plots from a series of experiments. At least the part of the
report containing the plots should be automatically generated by the
script that performs the set of experiments, because in that script we
know exactly which input data that were used to generate a specific
plot, thereby ensuring that each figure is connected to the
right data. Take a look at an
`example <http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/writing_reports/sphinx-cloud/>`_  to see what we have in
mind.

Plain HTML
~~~~~~~~~~

Scientific reports can be written in a variety of formats. Here we
begin with the `HTML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML>`_ format
which allows efficient browsing of all the experiments in any web
browser. An extended version of the ``dc_exper1.py`` from the last
section, called `dc_exper1_html.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/experiments/dc_exper1_html.py>`_,
adds code at the end for creating an HTML file with a summary, a
section on the mathematical problem, a section on the numerical
method, a section on the ``solver`` function implementing the
method, and a section with subsections containing figures that shows
the results of experiments where :math:`\Delta t` is varied for
:math:`\theta=0,0.5,1`. The mentioned
Python file contains all the details for writing
this `HTML report <http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/writing_reports/report_html.html>`_.

HTML with MathJax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scientific reports usually need mathematical formulas and hence
mathematical typesetting. In plain HTML, as used in the
``dc_exper1_html.py`` file, we have to use just the keyboard
characters to write mathematics. However, there is an extension to
HTML, called `MathJax <http://www.mathjax.org/>`_, that allows
formulas and equations to be typeset with LaTeX syntax and nicely
rendered in web browsers, see Figure :ref:`decay:exper:report:fig:mathjax`.
A relatively small subset of LaTeX
environments is supported, but the syntax for formulas is quite
rich. Inline formulas are look like ``\( u'=-au \)`` while equations are
surrounded by ``$$`` signs.  Inside such signs, one can use ``\[ u'=-au
\]`` for unnumbered equations, or ``\begin{equation}`` and
``\end{equation}`` surrounding ``u'=-au`` for numbered equations, or ``\begin{align}``
and ``\end{align}`` for multiple aligned equations, with (``align``) or
without (``align*``) numbers and labels.

The file `dc_exper1_mathjax.py <http://github.hplgit.com/INF5620/src/decay/experiments/dc_exper1_html.py>`_
contains all the details for turning the previous plain HTML report
into `web pages with nicely typeset mathematics <http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/writing_reports/report_html_mathjax.html>`_.


.. _decay:exper:report:fig:mathjax:

.. figure:: fig-decay/report_mathjax.png
   :width: 600

   *Report in HTML format with MathJax*


LaTeX
~~~~~

.. "http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX"


The *de facto* language for mathematical typesetting and scientific
report writing is `LaTeX <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX>`_, see
Figure :ref:`decay:exper:report:fig:latex` for an example. A
number of very sophisticated packages have been added to the language
over a period of three decades, allowing very fine-tuned layout and
typesetting. For output in the `PDF format <http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/writing_reports/report.pdf>`_, LaTeX is
the definite choice when it comes to quality. The LaTeX language used
to write the reports has typically a lot of commands involving
`backslashes and braces <http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/writing_reports/report.tex.html>`_.
For output on
the web, using HTML (and not the PDF directly in the browser window),
LaTeX struggles with delivering high quality typesetting. Other tools,
especially Sphinx, gives better results and can also produce
nice-looking PDFs.
The file ``dc_exper1_latex.py`` shows how to generate the LaTeX source
from a program.


.. _decay:exper:report:fig:latex:

.. figure:: fig-decay/report_latexpdf.png
   :width: 600

   *Report in PDF format generated from LaTeX source*


Sphinx
~~~~~~

.. give pointers to source pages


`Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ is a typesetting language with
similarities to HTML and LaTeX, but with much less tagging. It has
recently become very popular for software documentation and
mathematical reports. Sphinx can utilize LaTeX (via MathJax or PNG
images) for
mathematical formulas and equations. Unfortunately, the subset
of LaTeX mathematics supported is less than in full MathJax
(in particular, numbering of multiple equations in an ``align`` type environment
is not supported).
The Sphinx `syntax <http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/writing_reports/report_sphinx.rst.html>`_
is an extension of the reStructuredText language. An attractive feature
of Sphinx is its rich support for `fancy layout of web pages <http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/writing_reports/sphinx-cloud/index.html>`_. In
particular, Sphinx can easily be combined with various layout *themes*
that give a certain look and feel to the web site and that offers
table of contents, navigation, and search facilities, see
Figure :ref:`decay:exper:report:fig:sphinx`.


.. _decay:exper:report:fig:sphinx:

.. figure:: fig-decay/report_sphinx.png
   :width: 600

   *Report in HTML format generated from Sphinx source*


Markdown
~~~~~~~~

A recently popular format for easy writing of web pages is
`Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_.
Text is written very much like one would do in email, using
spacing and special characters to naturally format the code
instead of heavily tagging the text as in LaTeX and HTML.
With the tool `Pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_ one
can go from Markdown to a variety of formats.
HTML is a common output format, but LaTeX, epub, XML,
OpenOffice, MediaWiki, and MS Word are some other possibilities.

Wiki formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A range of wiki formats are popular for creating notes on the web,
especially documents which allow groups of people to edit and evolve
the content. Apart from `MediaWiki <http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki>`_ (the wiki format used for
Wikipedia), wiki formats have no support for mathematical typesetting
and also limited tools for displaying computer code in nice ways.
Wiki formats are therefore less suitable for scientific reports compared
to the other formats mentioned here.

Doconce
~~~~~~~

Since it is difficult to choose the right tool or format for writing
a scientific report, it is advantageous to write the content in a
format that easily can be translated to LaTeX, HTML, Sphinx, Markdown,
and wikis. `Doconce <http://code.google.com/p/doconce>`_ is such
a tool. It is similar to Pandoc, but offers some special convenient
features for writing about mathematics and programming.
The tagging is modest, `somewhere between LaTeX and Markdown <http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/writing_reports/report.do.txt.html>`_.
The program ``dc_exper_do.py`` demonstrates how to generate (and write)
Doconce code for a report.

Worked example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HTML, LaTeX (PDF), Sphinx, and Doconce formats for the scientific
report whose content is outlined above, are exemplified
with source codes and results at the
`web pages associated with this teaching material <http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/writing_reports/>`_.

.. project with exploring instability (help with matplotlib contour plots, and maybe show such a plot)


.. _decay:exper:github:

Publishing a complete project
-----------------------------

A report documenting scientific investigations should be accompanied by
all the software and data used for the investigations so that others
have a possibility to redo the work and assess the qualify of the results.
This possibility is important for *reproducible research* and
hence reaching reliable scientific conclusions.

One way of documenting a complete project is to make a folder tree
with all relevant files. Preferably, the tree is published at
some project hosting site like `Bitbucket, GitHub, or Googlecode <http://hplgit.github.com/teamods/bitgit/html/>`_ so that others can download it
as a tarfile, zipfile, or clone the files directly using a version control
system like Mercurial or Git.
For the investigations outlined in the section :ref:`decay:exper:report`,
we can create a folder tree with files

.. code-block:: text


        src/dc_mod.py
        setup.py
        doc/src/dc_exper1_mathjax.py
        doc/src/make_report.sh
        doc/src/run.sh
        doc/pub/report.html

The ``src`` directory holds source code (modules) to be reused in other project,
the ``setup.py`` builds and installs such software,
the ``doc`` directory contains the documentation, with ``src`` for the
source of the documentation and ``pub`` for ready-made, published documentation.
The ``run.sh`` file is a simple Bash script listing the ``python`` command
we used to run ``dc_exper1_mathjax.py`` to generate the experiments and
report documented in the final published ``report.html`` file.

for a given time mesh. Read input data for the problem from the

We want to solve the exponential decay problem :math:`u'=-au`, :math:`u(0)=I`,

For each :math:`\Delta t` value, we want to make a plot where the

must be added to allow the user to specify the :math:`\Delta t` values on

.. _decay:analysis:

Analysis of the :math:`\theta`-rule for a decay ODE
===================================================

We address the ODE for exponential decay,

.. math::
        
        u'(t) = -au(t),\quad u(0)=I,
        

where :math:`a` and :math:`I` are given constants. This problem is solved
by the :math:`\theta`-rule finite difference scheme, resulting in
the recursive equations

.. math::
   :label: decay:analysis:scheme
        
        u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n
        
        

for the numerical solution :math:`u^{n+1}`, which approximates the exact
solution :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}` at time point :math:`t_{n+1}`. For constant mesh spacing,
which we assume here, :math:`t_{n+1}=(n+1)\Delta t`.


Discouraging numerical solutions
--------------------------------

Choosing :math:`I=1`, :math:`a=2`, and running experiments with :math:`\theta =1,0.5, 0`
for :math:`\Delta t=1.25, 0.75, 0.5, 0.1`, gives the results in
Figures :ref:`decay:analysis:BE4c`, :ref:`decay:analysis:CN4c`, and
:ref:`decay:analysis:FE4c`.

   *Crank-Nicolson*



.. _decay:analysis:FE4c:

.. figure:: fig-decay/FE4c.png
   :width: 600

   *Forward Euler*


The characteristics of the displayed curves can be summarized as follows:

  * The Backward Euler scheme always give a monotone solution, lying above
    the exact curve.

  * The Crank-Nicolson scheme gives the most accurate results, but for
    :math:`\Delta t=1.25` the solution oscillates.

  * The Forward Euler scheme gives a growing, oscillating solution for
    :math:`\Delta t=1.25`; a decaying, oscillating solution for :math:`\Delta t=0.75`;
    a strange solution :math:`u^n=0` for :math:`n\geq 1` when :math:`\Delta t=0.5`; and
    a solution seemingly as accurate as the one by the Backward Euler
    scheme for :math:`\Delta t = 0.1`, but the curve lies below the exact
    solution.

Since the exact solution of our model problem is a monotone function,
:math:`u(t)=Ie^{-at}`, some of these qualitatively wrong results are indeed alarming!

Experimental investigation of oscillatory solutions
---------------------------------------------------

We may ask the question: Under what circumstances, i.e., values of
the input data :math:`I`, :math:`a`, and :math:`\Delta t` will the Forward Euler and
Crank-Nicolson schemes result in undesired oscillatory solutions?

We may set up an experiment where we loop over values of :math:`I`, :math:`a`,
and :math:`\Delta t`. For each experiment, we flag the solution as
oscillatory if

.. math::
         u^{n} > u^{n-1},

for some value of :math:`n`,
since we expect :math:`u^n` to decay with :math:`n`, but oscillations make
:math:`u` increase over a time step. We will quickly see that
oscillations are independent of :math:`I`, but do depend on :math:`a` and
:math:`\Delta t`. Therefore, we introduce a two-dimensional
function :math:`B(a,\Delta t)` which is 1 if oscillations occur
and 0 otherwise. We can visualize :math:`B` as a contour plot
(lines for which :math:`B=\hbox{const}`). The contour :math:`B=0.5` will
correspond to the borderline between oscillatory regions with :math:`B=1`
and monotone regions with :math:`B=0` in the :math:`a-\Delta t` plane.

The :math:`B` function is defined at discrete :math:`a` and :math:`\Delta t` values.
Say we have given :math:`P` $a$ values, :math:`a_0,\ldots,a_{P-1}`, and
:math:`Q` $\Delta t$ values, :math:`\Delta t_0,\ldots,\Delta t_{Q-1}`.
These :math:`a_i` and :math:`\Delta t_j` values, :math:`i=0,\ldots,P-1`,
:math:`j=0,\ldots,Q-1`, form a rectangular mesh of :math:`P\times Q` points
in the plane. At each point :math:`(a_i, \Delta t_j)`, we associate
the corresponding value of :math:`B(a_i,\Delta t_j)`, denoted :math:`B_{ij}`.
The :math:`B_{ij}` values are naturally stored in a two-dimensional
array. Both Matplotlib and SciTools can create a plot of the
contour line :math:`B_{ij}=0.5` dividing the oscillatory and monotone
regions. The file `dc_osc_regions.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_osc_regions.py>`_ contains all nuts and
bolts to produce the :math:`B=0.5` line in Figures :ref:`decay:analysis:B:FE`
and :ref:`decay:analysis:B:CN`. The oscillatory region is above this line.

By looking at the curves in the figures one may guess that :math:`a\Delta t`
must be less than a critical limit to avoid the undesired
oscillations.  This limit seems to be about 2 for Crank-Nicolson and 1
for Forward Euler.  We shall now establish a mathematical analysis of
the discrete model that can explain the observations in our numerical
experiments.

Exact numerical solution
------------------------

Starting with :math:`u^0=I`, the simple recursion :eq:`decay:analysis:scheme`
can be applied repeatedly :math:`n` times, with the result that

.. math::
   :label: decay:analysis:unex
        
        u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}u^n\thinspace .
        
        


Difference equations where all terms are linear in
:math:`u^{n+1}`, :math:`u^n`, and maybe :math:`u^{n-1}`, :math:`u^{n-2}`, etc., are
called *homogeneous, linear* difference equations, and their solutions
are generally of the form :math:`u^n=A^n`. Inserting this expression
and dividing by :math:`A^{n+1}` gives
a polynomial equation in :math:`A`. In the present case we get

.. math::
         A = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}\thinspace .

This is a solution technique of wider applicability than repeated use of
the recursion :eq:`decay:analysis:scheme`.

Regardless of the solution approach, we have obtained a formula for
:math:`u^n`.  This formula can explain everything what we see in the figures
above, but it also gives us a more general insight into accuracy and
stability properties of the three schemes.

Stability
---------


.. index:: stability criterion


Since :math:`u^n` is a factor


.. math::
        
        A = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a\Delta t}{1 + \theta a\Delta t}
        

raised to an integer power (:math:`n`), we realize that :math:`A<0`
will for odd powers imply :math:`u^n<0` and for even power result in :math:`u^n>0`,
i.e., a solution that oscillates between the mesh points.
We have that :math:`A<0` when


.. math::
   :label: decay:th:stability
        
        (1-\theta)a\Delta t > 1 \thinspace .
        
        

Since :math:`A>0` is a requirement for having a numerical solution with the
same basic property (monotonicity) as the exact solution, we may say
that :math:`A>0` is a *stability criterion*. Expressed in terms of :math:`\Delta t`
the stability criterion reads


.. math::
        
        \Delta t \leq \frac{1}{(1-\theta)a}\thinspace .
        


The Backward
Euler scheme is always stable (since :math:`A<0` is impossible), while
non-oscillating solutions for Forward Euler and Crank-Nicolson
demand :math:`\Delta t\leq 1/a` and :math:`\Delta t\leq 2/a`, respectively.
The relation between :math:`\Delta t` and :math:`a` look reasonable: a smaller
:math:`a` means faster decay and hence a need for smaller time steps.

Looking at Figure :ref:`decay:analysis:FE4c`, we see that with :math:`a\Delta
t= 2\cdot 1.25=2.5`, :math:`A=-1.5`, and the solution :math:`u^n=(-1.5)^n`
oscillates *and* grows. With :math:`a\Delta t = 2\cdot 0.75=1.5`, :math:`A=-0.5`,
:math:`u^n=(-0.5)^n` decays but oscillates. The peculiar case :math:`\Delta t =
0.5`, where the Forward Euler scheme produces a solution that is stuck
on the :math:`t` axis, corresponds to :math:`A=0` and therefore :math:`u^0=I=1` and
:math:`u^n=0` for :math:`n\geq 1`.  The decaying oscillations in the Crank-Nicolson scheme
for :math:`\Delta t=1.25` is easily explained by :math:`A=-0.25`.


.. index:: amplification factor


The factor :math:`A` is called *amplification factor* since the solution at
a new time level is :math:`A` times the solution at the previous time level. For
a decay process, we must obviously have :math:`|A|\leq 1` for all :math:`\Delta
t`, which is fulfilled for :math:`\theta \geq 1/2`. Arbitrarily large values
of :math:`u` can be generated when :math:`|A|>1` and :math:`n` is large enough. The
numerical solution is in such cases totally irrelevant to an ODE modeling decay
processes.


Comparing Amplification Factors
-------------------------------

After establishing how :math:`A` impacts the qualitative features of the
solution, we shall now look more into how well the numerical amplification
factor approximates the exact one. The exact solution reads
:math:`u(t)=Ie^{-at}`, which can be rewritten as

.. math::
        
        {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(t_n) = Ie^{-a n\Delta t} = I(e^{-a\Delta t})^n \thinspace .
        

From this formula we see that the exact amplification factor is

.. math::
        
        A_{\small\mbox{e}} = e^{-a\Delta t} \thinspace .
        


We realize that the exact and numerical amplification factors depend
on :math:`a` and :math:`\Delta t` through the product :math:`a\Delta t`. Therefore, it
is convenient to introduce a symbol for this product, :math:`p=a\Delta t`,
and view :math:`A` and :math:`A_{\small\mbox{e}}` as functions of :math:`p`. Figure
:ref:`decay:analysis:fig:A` shows these functions. Crank-Nicolson is
clearly closest to the exact amplification factor, but that method has
the unfortunate oscillatory behavior when :math:`p>2`.


.. _decay:analysis:fig:A:

   :width: 500

   *Comparison of amplification factors*



Series Expansion of Amplification Factors
-----------------------------------------

As an alternative to the visual understanding
inherent in Figure :ref:`decay:analysis:fig:A`, there
is a strong tradition in numerical analysis to investigate
approximation errors when the discretization parameter, here :math:`\Delta t`,
becomes small. In the present case we let :math:`p` be our small
discretization parameter, and it makes sense to simplify the
expressions for :math:`A` and :math:`A_{\small\mbox{e}}` by using Taylor polynomials around :math:`p=0`.
The Taylor polynomials are accurate for small :math:`p` and greatly simplifies
the comparison of the analytical expressions since we then can compare
polynomials, term by term.

Calculating the Taylor series for :math:`A_{\small\mbox{e}}` is easily done by hand, but
the three versions of :math:`A` for :math:`\theta=0,1,\frac{1}{2}` lead to more
cumbersome calculations.
Nowadays, analytical computations can benefit greatly by
symbolic computer algebra software. The Python package ``sympy``
represents a powerful computer algebra system, not as sophisticated as
the famous Maple and Mathematica systems, but free and
very easy to integrate with our numerical computations in Python.

When using ``sympy``, it is convenient to enter the interactive Python
mode where we can write expressions and statements and immediately see
the results.  Here is a simple example. We strongly recommend to use
``isympy`` (or ``ipython``) for such interactive sessions, although our
typesetting will apply the different prompt ``>>>`` (associated with the
primitive Python shell that results from writing ``python`` in a
terminal window).

Let us enter ``sympy`` in a Python shell and show how
we can find the Taylor series for :math:`e^{-p}`:

.. code-block:: python

        >>> from sympy import *
        >>> p = Symbol('p')  # all variables must be declared as Symbols
        >>> A_e = exp(-p)
        >>>
        >>> # First 6 terms of the Taylor series of A_e
        >>> A_e.series(p, 6)
        1 + (1/2)*p**2 - p - 1/6*p**3 - 1/120*p**5 + (1/24)*p**4 + O(p**6)

Lines with ``>>>`` represent input lines and lines without
this prompt represents the result of computations.
Apart from the order of the powers, the computed formula is easily
recognized as the beginning of the Taylor series for :math:`e^{-p}`.

Let us define the numerical amplification factor where :math:`p` and :math:`\theta`
enter the formula as symbols:

.. code-block:: python

        >>> theta = Symbol('theta')
        >>> A = (1-(1-theta)*p)/(1+theta*p)

To work with the factor for the Backward Euler scheme we
can substitute the value 1 for ``theta``:

.. code-block:: python

        >>> A.subs(theta, 1)
        1/(1 + p)

Similarly, we can substitute ``theta`` by 1/2 for Crank-Nicolson,
preferably using an exact rational representation of 1/2 in ``sympy``:

.. code-block:: python

        >>> half = Rational(1,2)
        >>> A.subs(theta, half)
        1/(1 + (1/2)*p)*(1 - 1/2*p)


The Taylor series of the amplification factor for the Crank-Nicolson
scheme can be computed as

.. code-block:: python

        >>> A.subs(theta, half).series(p, 4)
        1 + (1/2)*p**2 - p - 1/4*p**3 + O(p**4)

We are now in a position to compare Taylor series:

.. code-block:: python

        >>> FE = A_e.series(p, 4) - A.subs(theta, 0).series(p, 4)
        >>> BE = A_e.series(p, 4) - A.subs(theta, 1).series(p, 4)
        >>> CN = A_e.series(p, 4) - A.subs(theta, half).series(p, 4)
        >>> FE
        (1/2)*p**2 - 1/6*p**3 + O(p**4)
        >>> BE
        -1/2*p**2 + (5/6)*p**3 + O(p**4)
        >>> CN
        (1/12)*p**3 + O(p**4)

From these expressions we see that the error :math:`A-A_{\small\mbox{e}}\sim {\cal O}(p^2)`
for the Forward and Backward Euler schemes, while
:math:`A-A_{\small\mbox{e}}\sim {\cal O}(p^3)` for the Crank-Nicolson scheme.
It is the *leading order term*,
i.e., the term of the lowest order (degree),
that is of interest, because as :math:`p\rightarrow 0`, this term is
(much) bigger than the higher-order terms.

Now, :math:`a` is a given parameter in the problem, while :math:`\Delta t` is
what we can vary. One therefore usually writes the error expressions in
terms :math:`\Delta t`. When then have

.. math::
        
        A-A_{\small\mbox{e}} = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        {\cal O}(\Delta t^2), & \hbox{Forward and Backward Euler},\\
        {\cal O}(\Delta t^3), & \hbox{Crank-Nicolson}
        \end{array}\right.
        

What is the significance of this result? If we halve :math:`\Delta t`,
the error in amplification factor at a time level will be reduced
by a factor of 4 in the Forward and Backward Euler schemes, and by
a factor of 8 in the Crank-Nicolson scheme. That is, as we
reduce :math:`\Delta t` to obtain more accurate results, the Crank-Nicolson
scheme reduces the error more efficiently than the other schemes.

Local error
-----------

(max/infinity norm etc).
Both errors can be investigated analytically.]

Analytical comparison of schemes
--------------------------------

An alternative comparison of the schemes is to look at the
ratio :math:`A/A_{\small\mbox{e}}`, or the error :math:`1-A/A_{\small\mbox{e}}` in this ratio:

.. code-block:: python

        >>> FE = 1 - (A.subs(theta, 0)/A_e).series(p, 4)
        >>> BE = 1 - (A.subs(theta, 1)/A_e).series(p, 4)
        >>> CN = 1 - (A.subs(theta, half)/A_e).series(p, 4)
        >>> FE

        >>> CN
        (1/12)*p**3 + O(p**4)

The leading-order terms have the same powers as
in the analysis of :math:`A-A_{\small\mbox{e}}`.

The real (global) error at a point
----------------------------------

The error in the amplification factor reflects the error when
progressing from time level :math:`t_n` to :math:`t_{n-1}`.
To investigate the real error at a point, known as the *global error*,
we look at :math:`u^n-u_{\small\mbox{e}}(t_n)` for some :math:`n` and Taylor expand the
mathematical expressions as functions of :math:`p=a\Delta t`:

.. code-block:: python

        >>> n = Symbol('n')
        >>> u_e = exp(-p*n)
        >>> u_n = A**n
        >>> FE = u_e.series(p, 4) - u_n.subs(theta, 0).series(p, 4)
        >>> BE = u_e.series(p, 4) - u_n.subs(theta, 1).series(p, 4)
        >>> CN = u_e.series(p, 4) - u_n.subs(theta, half).series(p, 4)
        >>> FE
        (1/2)*n*p**2 - 1/2*n**2*p**3 + (1/3)*n*p**3 + O(p**4)
        >>> BE
        (1/2)*n**2*p**3 - 1/2*n*p**2 + (1/3)*n*p**3 + O(p**4)
        >>> CN
        (1/12)*n*p**3 + O(p**4)

For a fixed time :math:`t`, the parameter :math:`n` in these expressions increases
as :math:`p\rightarrow 0` since :math:`t=n\Delta t`. That is, :math:`n=t/\Delta t`, and
the leading-order error terms therefore become :math:`\frac{1}{2}na^2\Delta
t^2 = \frac{1}{2}ta^2t\Delta t` for the Forward and Backward Euler
scheme, and :math:`\frac{1}{12}na^3\Delta t^3 = \frac{1}{12}ta^3\Delta t^2`
for the Crank-Nicolson scheme.  The global error is therefore of
second order in :math:`\Delta t` for the latter scheme and first order for
the former schemes.

Integrated errors
-----------------

The formulas for various error measures have so far measured the
error at one time point. Many prefer to use the error
integrated over the whole time interval of interest: :math:`[0,T]`.
An immediate practical problem arises, however, since the
numerical solution is only known at the mesh points, while an
integration will need this solution also at the points between
the mesh points. Let :math:`\tilde u` be a continuous representation
of the numerical solution, usually obtained by drawing straight
lines between the values at the mesh points. Then
a common measure of the global error is the so-called :math:`L^2` error:

.. math::
        
        E_2 = \sqrt{\int_0^T ({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(t) - \tilde u(t))^2dt} \thinspace .
        

A family of such measures is the :math:`L^p` errors, defined as

.. math::
        
        E_p = \left(\int_0^T ({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(t) - \tilde u(t))^pdt\right)^{1/p} \thinspace .
        

For :math:`p=1` we just take the absolute value of the integrand.

Strictly speaking, it is questionable in a finite difference method
to introduce an additional approximation in the error measure,
namely how :math:`\tilde u` varies
between the mesh points. Some may argue and say that the numerical
solution is defined at the mesh points only and that we should
approximate the integrals above by numerical methods involving
the integrand at just the mesh points. The numerical integration
method also represents an approximation, but a discrete integration
procedure is consistent with having only discrete values of the integrand.

For uniformly distributed mesh points we have the well-known Trapezoidal
rule,

.. math::
   :label: decay:E2:Tr
        
        E_2 \approx \left(\Delta t\left( \frac{1}{2} ({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(0) - u^0)^2
        + \frac{1}{2} ({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(T) - u^N)^2  + \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} ({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(k\Delta t) - u^k)^2 \right)
        \right)^{1/2} \thinspace .
        
        

In case the mesh points are arbitrarily spaced, we have an immediate
generalization in terms of the sum of the various trapezoids:

.. math::
   :label: decay:E2:Trg
        
        E_2 \approx \left(\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}(t_{k+1} - t_k)
        \left( ({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(k\Delta t) - u^k)^2 + ({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}((k+1)\Delta t) - u^{k+1})^2\right)
        \right)^{1/2} \thinspace .
        
        

A simpler approximation is to use rectangles whose heights are determined
by the left (or right) value in each interval:

.. math::
   :label: decay:E2:Reg1
        
        E_2 \approx \left(\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}(t_{k+1} - t_k)({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(k\Delta t) - u^k)^2
        \right)^{1/2} \thinspace .
        
        

With uniformly distributed mesh points we get the simplification

.. math::
   :label: decay:E2:Reg
        
        E_2 \approx \left(\Delta t\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(k\Delta t) - u^k)^2
        \right)^{1/2} \thinspace .
        
        


Suppose that in a program the :math:`u^k` values are available as elements
in the array ``u``, while the :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(k\Delta t)` values are available
as elements in the array ``u_e``. The formula :eq:`decay:E2:Reg` can
then be calculated as follows by array arithmetics in Python:


.. code-block:: python

        E2 = sqrt(dt*sum((u_e - u)**2))

This is exactly the "array formula" that popped up in
the section :ref:`decay:computing:error`.

Integrated error measures sum up the contributions from each mesh point,
so we must expect the global error to be larger than
the local error. Roughly speaking, if :math:`|u_{\small\mbox{e}}(t_n) - u^n|\sim ta^{r+1}\Delta t^r`, we have

.. math::
         E \approx \sqrt{\Delta t\sum_{i=0}^N i^2a^{2(r+1)}\Delta t^{2r+1}} =
        \sqrt{a^{2(r+1)}\Delta t^{2r+2} \sum_i i^2} \approx
        a^{r+1}\Delta t^{r+1} N^{3/2} = a^{r+1}\Delta t^{r-1/2} T^{3/2} ,

since :math:`t=i\Delta t`, :math:`\sum_{i=0}^N i^2\approx \frac{1}{3}N^3`, and
:math:`N=T/Delta t`.

Model extensions
================

It is time to consider generalizations of the simple decay model
:math:`u=-au`, where :math:`a` is constant, and also to look at other numerical
solution methods.

Generalization: including a variable coefficient
------------------------------------------------

In the ODE for decay, :math:`u'=-au`, we now consider the case where :math:`a`
depends on time:


.. math::
   :label: decay:problem:a
        
        u'(t) = -a(t)u(t),\quad t\in (0,T],\quad u(0)=I \thinspace .
        
        


A Forward Euler scheme consist of evaluating :eq:`decay:problem:a`
at :math:`t=t_n` and approximating the derivative with a forward
difference :math:`[D^+_t u]^n`:


.. math::
        
        \frac{u^{n+1} - u^n}{\Delta t} = -a(t_n)u^n
        \thinspace .
        

The Backward Euler scheme becomes

.. math::
        
        \frac{u^{n} - u^{n-1}}{\Delta t} = -a(t_n)u^n
        \thinspace .
        

The Crank-Nicolson method builds on sampling the ODE at
:math:`t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}`. We can evaluate :math:`a` at :math:`t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}`
and use an average for :math:`u` at
times :math:`t_n` and :math:`t_{n+1}`:

.. math::
        
        \frac{u^{n+1} - u^{n}}{\Delta t} = -a(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}})\frac{1}{2}(u^n + u^{n+1})
        \thinspace .
        

Alternatively, we can use an average for the product :math:`au`:


.. math::
        
        \frac{u^{n+1} - u^{n}}{\Delta t} = -\frac{1}{2}(a(t_n)u^n + a(t_{n+1})u^{n+1})
        \thinspace .
        

The :math:`\theta`-rule unifies the three mentioned schemes. Either with :math:`a`
evaluated at :math:`t_{n+\theta}`,


.. math::
        
        \frac{u^{n+1} - u^{n}}{\Delta t} = -a((1-\theta)t_n + \theta t_{n+1})((1-\theta) u^n + \theta u^{n+1})
        \thinspace .
        

or using a weighted average for the product :math:`au`,

.. math::
        
        \frac{u^{n+1} - u^{n}}{\Delta t} = -(1-\theta) a(t_n)u^n - \theta
        a(t_{n+1})u^{n+1}
        \thinspace .
        


With the finite difference operator notation the Forward Euler and Backward
Euler schemes can be summarized as


.. math::
        
        \lbrack D^+_t u &= -au\rbrack^n,\\
        \lbrack D^-_t u &= -au\rbrack^n
        \thinspace .
        

The Crank-Nicolson and :math:`\theta` schemes depend on whether we evaluate
:math:`a` at the sample point for the ODE or if we use an average. The
various versions are written as


.. math::
        
        \lbrack D_t u &= -a\overline{u}^t\rbrack^{n+\frac{1}{2}},\\
        \lbrack D_t u &= -\overline{au}^t\rbrack^{n+\frac{1}{2}},\\
        \lbrack D_t u &= -a\overline{u}^{t,\theta}\rbrack^{n+\theta},\\
        \lbrack D_t u &= -\overline{au}^{t,\theta}\rbrack^{n+\theta}
        \thinspace .
        



.. _decay:source:

Generalization: including a source term
---------------------------------------

A further extension of the model ODE is to include a source term :math:`b(t)`:


.. math::
   :label: decay:problem:ab
        
        u'(t) = -a(t)u(t) + b(t),\quad t\in (0,T],\quad u(0)=I
        \thinspace .
        
        


Schemes
~~~~~~~

The time point where we sample the ODE determines where :math:`b(t)` is
evaluated. For the Crank-Nicolson scheme and the :math:`\theta`-rule we
have a choice of whether to evaluate :math:`a(t)` and :math:`b(t)` at the
correct point or use an average. The chosen strategy becomes
particularly clear if we write up the schemes in the operator notation:


.. math::
   :label: decay:problem:ab:theta:avg:all:op
        
        \lbrack D^+_t u &= -au + b\rbrack^n,\\
        \lbrack D^-_t u &= -au + b\rbrack^n,\\
        \lbrack D_t u   &= -a\overline{u}^t + b\rbrack^{n+\frac{1}{2}},\\
        \lbrack D_t u   &= \overline{-au+b}^t\rbrack^{n+\frac{1}{2}},\\
        \lbrack D_t u   &= -a\overline{u}^{t,\theta} + b\rbrack^{n+\theta},\\
        \lbrack D_t u   &= \overline{-au+b}^{t,\theta}\rbrack^{n+\theta}
        
        \thinspace .
        


.. _decay:general:

Implementation of the generalized model problem
-----------------------------------------------

Deriving the :math:`\theta`-rule formula
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writing out the :math:`\theta`-rule in :eq:`decay:problem:ab:theta:avg:all:op`,
using :eq:`decay:fd1:Du:theta`
and :eq:`decay:fd1:wmean:a`, we get

.. math::
   :label: decay:problem:ab:theta:avg:all
        
        \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t} = \theta(-a^{n+1}u^{n+1} + b^{n+1}))
        + (1-\theta)(-a^nu^{n} + b^n)),
        
        

where :math:`a^n` means evaluating :math:`a` at :math:`t=t_n` and similar for
:math:`a^{n+1}`, :math:`b^n`, and :math:`b^{n+1}`.
We solve for :math:`u^{n+1}`:

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} = ((1 - \Delta t(1-\theta)a^n)u^n
        + \Delta t(\theta b^{n+1} + (1-\theta)b^n))(1 + \Delta t\theta a^{n+1})^{-1}
        \thinspace .
        


The Python code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a suitable implementation of :eq:`decay:problem:ab:theta:avg:all`
where :math:`a(t)` and :math:`b(t)` are given as
Python functions:


.. code-block:: python

        def solver(I, a, b, T, dt, theta):
            """
            Solve u'=-a(t)*u + b(t), u(0)=I,
            for t in (0,T] with steps of dt.
            a and b are Python functions of t.
            """
            dt = float(dt)           # avoid integer division
            N = int(round(T/dt))     # no of time intervals
            T = N*dt                 # adjust T to fit time step dt
            u = zeros(N+1)           # array of u[n] values
            t = linspace(0, T, N+1)  # time mesh
        
            u[0] = I                 # assign initial condition
            for n in range(0, N):    # n=0,1,...,N-1
                u[n+1] = ((1 - dt*(1-theta)*a(t[n]))*u[n] + \ 
                          dt*(theta*b(t[n+1]) + (1-theta)*b(t[n])))/\ 
                          (1 + dt*theta*a(t[n+1]))
            return u, t

This function is found in the file `dc_vc.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_vc.py>`_.

Coding of variable coefficients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``solver`` function shown above demands the arguments ``a`` and ``b`` to
be Python functions of time ``t``, say


.. code-block:: python

        def a(t):
            return a_0 if t < tp else k*a_0
        
        def b(t):
            return 1

Here, ``a(t)`` has three parameters ``a0``, ``tp``, and ``k``,
which must be global variables.
A better implementation is to represent ``a`` by a class where the
parameters are attributes and a *special method* ``__call__`` evaluates :math:`a(t)`:


.. code-block:: python

        class A:
            def __init__(self, a0=1, k=2):
                self.a0, self.k = a0, k
        
            def __call__(self, t):
                return self.a0 if t < self.tp else self.k*self.a0
        
        a = A(a0=2, k=1)  # a behaves as a function a(t)



.. index:: lambda functions


For quick tests it is cumbersome to write a complete function or a class.
The *lambda function* construction in Python is then convenient. For example,

.. code-block:: python

        a = lambda t: a_0 if t < tp else k*a_0

is equivalent to the ``def a(t):`` definition above. In general,

.. code-block:: python

        f = lambda arg1, arg2, ...: expressin

is equivalent to

.. code-block:: python

        def f(arg1, arg2, ...):
            return expression

One can use lambda functions directly in calls. Say we want to
solve :math:`u'=-u+1`, :math:`u(0)=2`:

.. code-block:: python

        u, t = solver(2, lambda t: 1, lambda t: 1, T, dt, theta)

A lambda function can appear anywhere where a variable can appear.

.. _decay:verify:trivial:

Verification via trivial solutions
----------------------------------

A very useful partial verification method is to construct a test
problem with a very simple solution, usually :math:`u=\hbox{const}`.
Especially the initial debugging of a program code can benefit greatly
from such tests, because 1) all relevant numerical methods will
exactly reproduce a constant solution, and 2) many of the intermediate
calculations are easy to control for a constant :math:`u`.

The only constant solution for the problem :math:`u'=-au`
is :math:`u=0`, but too many bugs can escape from that trivial solution.
It is much better to search for a problem where :math:`u=C=\hbox{const}\neq 0`.
Then :math:`u'=-a(t)u + b(t)` is more appropriate. With :math:`u=C`
we can choose any :math:`a(t)` and set :math:`b=a(t)C` and
:math:`I=C`. An appropriate nose test is


.. code-block:: python

        import nose.tools as nt
        
        def test_constant_solution():
            """
            Test problem where u=u_const is the exact solution, to be
            reproduced (to machine precision) by any relevant method.
            """
            def exact_solution(t):
                return u_const
        
            def a(t):
                return 2.5*(1+t**3)  # can be arbitrary
        
            def b(t):
                return a(t)*u_const
        
            u_const = 2.15
            theta = 0.4; I = u_const; dt = 4
            N = 4  # enough with a few steps
            u, t = solver(I=I, a=a, b=b, T=N*dt, dt=dt, theta=theta)
            print u
            u_e = exact_solution(t)
            difference = abs(u_e - u).max()  # max deviation
            nt.assert_almost_equal(difference, 0, places=14)


An interesting question is what type of bugs that will make the
computed :math:`u^n` to deviate from the exact solution :math:`C`.
Fortunately, the updating formula and the initial condition must
be absolutely correct for the test to pass! Any attempt to make
a wrong indexing in terms like ``a(t[n])`` or any attempt to
introduce an erroneous factor in the formula creates a solution
that is different from :math:`C`.


.. _decay:MMS:

Verification via manufactured solutions
---------------------------------------


.. index:: method of manufactured solutions


.. index:: MMS (method of manufactured solutions)


Following the idea of the previous section, we can choose any formula
as the exact solution, insert the formula in the ODE problem and fit
the data :math:`a(t)`, :math:`b(t)`, and :math:`I` to make the chosen
formula fulfill the equation. This
powerful technique for generating exact solutions is very useful for
verification purposes and known as the *method of manufactured
solutions*, often abbreviated MMS.

One common choice of solution is a linear function in the independent
variable(s). The rationale behind such a simple variation is that
almost any relevant numerical solution method for differential
equation problems is able to reproduce the linear function exactly to
machine precision (if :math:`u` is about unity in size; precision is lost if
:math:`u` take on large values, see :ref:`decay:fd2:exer:precision`).
The linear solution also makes some stronger demands to the
numerical method and the implementation than the constant solution
used in the section :ref:`decay:verify:trivial`, at least in more
complicated applications. However, the constant solution is often
ideal for initial debugging before proceeding with a linear solution.

We choose :math:`u(t) = ct + d`. We must then have :math:`d=I` from the initial condition.
Inserting this :math:`u` in the ODE results in

.. math::
         c = -a(t)u + b(t) \thinspace . 

Any function :math:`u=ct+I` is then a correct solution if we choose

.. math::
         b(t) = c + a(t)(ct + I) \thinspace . 

With this :math:`b(t)` there are no restrictions on :math:`a(t)` and :math:`c`.

Let us see if such a linear solution obeys the numerical
schemes. That is, we must check that :math:`u^n = ca(t_n)(ct_n+I)` fits
the discrete equations. To this end, it is convenient to
compute the action of a difference operator on :math:`u^n=t_n`:


.. math::
   :label: decay:fd2:Dop:tn:cn
        
        \lbrack D_t^+ t\rbrack^n &= \frac{t_{n+1}-t_n}{\Delta t}=\frac{(n+1)\Delta t - n\Delta t}{\Delta t}=1,\\
        \lbrack D_t^- t\rbrack^n &= \frac{t_{n}-t_{n-1}}{\Delta t}=\frac{n\Delta t - (n-1)\Delta t}{\Delta t}=1,\\
        \lbrack D_t t\rbrack^n &= \frac{t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}-t_{n-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Delta t}=\frac{(n+\frac{1}{2})\Delta t - (n-\frac{1}{2})\Delta t}{\Delta t}=1
        
        \thinspace .

         [D^+_t u = -au + b]^n, 

with :math:`a^n=a(t_n)`, :math:`b^n=c + a(t_n)(ct_n + I)`, and :math:`u^n=ct_n + I`
then results in


.. math::
         c = -a(t_n)(ct_n+I) + c + a(t_n)(ct_n + I) = c 

which is always fulfilled. Similar calculations can be done for the
Backward Euler and Crank-Nicolson schemes, or the :math:`\theta`-rule for
that matter. In all cases, :math:`u^n=ct_n +I` is an exact solution of
the discrete equations. That is why we should expect that
:math:`u^n - u_{\small\mbox{e}}(t_n) =0` mathematically and :math:`|u^n - u_{\small\mbox{e}}(t_n)|` less
than a small number about the machine precision for :math:`n=0,\ldots,N`.

The following function offers an implementation of this verification
test based on a linear exact solution:


.. code-block:: python

        def test_linear_solution():
            """
            Test problem where u=c*t+I is the exact solution, to be
            reproduced (to machine precision) by any relevant method.
            """
            def exact_solution(t):
                return c*t + I
        
            def a(t):
                return t**0.5  # can be arbitrary
        
            def b(t):
                return c + a(t)*exact_solution(t)
        
            theta = 0.4; I = 0.1; dt = 0.1; c = -0.5
            T = 4
            N = int(T/dt)  # no of steps
            u, t = solver(I=I, a=a, b=b, T=N*dt, dt=dt, theta=theta)
            u_e = exact_solution(t)
            difference = abs(u_e - u).max()  # max deviation
            print difference
            # No of decimal places for comparison depend on size of c
            nt.assert_almost_equal(difference, 0, places=14)

As in the section :ref:`decay:verify:trivial`, any error in the updating
formula makes this test fail.

Choosing more complicated formulas as the exact solution, say
:math:`\cos(t)`, will not make the numerical and exact solution
coincide to machine precision. In such cases, the verification procedure
must be based on measuring the convergence rates as exemplified in
the section :ref:`decay:convergence:rate`. This is possible since one has
an exact solution of a problem that the solver can be tested on.


Extension to systems of ODEs
----------------------------

Many ODE models involves more than one unknown function and more
than one equation. Here is an example of two unknown functions :math:`u(t)`
and :math:`v(t)` (modeling, e.g., the radioactive decay of two substances):


.. math::
        
        u' &= -a_u u + a_vv,\\
        v' &= -a_vv + a_uu,
        

for constants :math:`a_u, a_v>0`.
Applying the Forward Euler method to each equation results in simple
updating formula

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} &= u^n + \Delta t (-a_u u^n + a_vv^n),\\
        v^{n+1} &= u^n + \Delta t (-a_vv^n + a_uu^n)
        \thinspace .
        

However, the Crank-Nicolson or Backward Euler schemes result in a
:math:`2\times 2` linear system for the new unknowns. The latter schemes gives

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} &= u^n + \Delta t (-a_u u^{n+1} + a_vv^{n+1}),\\
        v^{n+1} &= v^n + \Delta t (-a_vv^{n+1} + a_uu^{n+1}),
        

and bringing :math:`u^{n+1}` as well as :math:`v^{n+1}` on the left-hand side results
in

.. math::
        
        (1 + \Delta t a_u)u^{n+1} + a_vv^{n+1}) &= u^n ,\\
        a_uu^{n+1} + (1 + \Delta t a_v) v^{n+1} &= v^n ,
        

which is a system of two coupled, linear, algebraic equations in two
unknowns.


General first-order ODEs
========================

We now turn the attention to general, nonlinear ODEs and systems of
such ODEs.  Many schemes that are often reused for time-discretization
of PDEs are listed. We also demonstrate a Python interface to a range
of different software for general first-order ODE systems.

Generic form
------------

ODEs are commonly written in the generic form


.. math::
   :label: decay:ode:general
        
        u' = f(u,t),\quad u(0)=I,
        
        

where :math:`f(u,t)`  is a prescribed function.
As an example, our most
general exponential decay model :eq:`decay:problem:ab` has
:math:`f(u,t)=-a(t)u(t) + b(t)`.

The unknown :math:`u` in :eq:`decay:ode:general` may either be
a scalar function of time :math:`t`, or a vector valued function of :math:`t` in
case of a *system of ODEs*:

.. math::
         u(t) = (u^{(0)}(t),u^{(1)}(t),\ldots,u^{(m-1)}(t)) \thinspace . 

In that case, the right-hand side is vector-valued function with :math:`m`
components,

.. math::
        
        f(u, t) = ( & f^{(0)}(u^{(0)}(t),\ldots,u^{(m-1)}(t)),\\
                    & f^{(1)}(u^{(0)}(t),\ldots,u^{(m-1)}(t)),\\
                    & \vdots,\\
                    & f^{(m-1)}(u^{(0)}(t),\ldots,u^{(m-1)}(t)))
        \thinspace .
        


Actually, any system of ODEs can
be written in the form :eq:`decay:ode:general`, but higher-order
ODEs then need auxiliary unknown functions.

The Odespy software
-------------------

A wide range of the methods and software exist for solving :eq:`decay:ode:general`.
Many of methods are accessible through a unified Python interface offered
by the `Odespy <https://github.com/hplgit/odespy>`_ package.
Odespy features simple Python implementations of the most fundamental
schemes as well as Python interfaces to several famous packages for
solving ODEs: `ODEPACK <https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/odepack/odepack_home.html>`_, `Vode <https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/odepack/odepack_home.html>`_,
`rkc.f <http://www.netlib.org/ode/rkc.f>`_, `rkf45.f <http://www.netlib.org/ode/rkf45.f>`_, `Radau5 <http://www.unige.ch/~hairer/software.html>`_, as well
as the ODE solvers in `SciPy <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.ode.html>`_, `SymPy <http://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/mpmath/calculus/odes.html>`_, and `odelab <http://olivierverdier.github.com/odelab/>`_.

The usage of Odespy follows this setup for the ODE :math:`u'=-au`,
:math:`u(0)=I`, :math:`t\in (0,T]`, here solved
by the famous 4th-order Runge-Kutta method, using :math:`\Delta t=1`
and :math:`N=6` steps:


.. code-block:: text


        def f(u, t):
            return -a*u
        
        import odespy
        import numpy as np
        
        I = 1; a = 0.5; N = 6; dt = 1
        solver = odespy.RK4(f)
        solver.set_initial_condition(I)
        t_mesh = np.linspace(0, N*dt, N+1)
        u, t = solver.solve(t_mesh)


Example: Runge-Kutta methods
----------------------------

Since all solvers have the same interface, modulo different set of
parameters to the solvers' constructors, one can easily make a list of
solver objects and run a loop for comparing (a lot of) solvers. The
code below, found in complete form in `dc_odespy.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/decay/dc_odespy.py>`_,
compares the famous Runge-Kutta methods of orders 2, 3, and 4
with the exact solution of the decay equation
:math:`u'=-au`.
Since we have quite long time steps, we have included the only
relevant :math:`\theta`-rule for large time steps, the BackwardEuler scheme
(:math:`\theta=1`), as well.
Figure :ref:`decay:odespy:fig1` shows the results.


.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        import scitools.std as plt
        import sys
        
        def f(u, t):
            return -a*u
        
        I = 1; a = 2; T = 6
        dt = float(sys.argv[1]) if len(sys.argv) >= 2 else 0.75
        N = int(round(T/dt))
        t = np.linspace(0, N*dt, N+1)
        
        solvers = [odespy.RK2(f),
                   odespy.RK3(f),
                   odespy.RK4(f),
                   odespy.BackwardEuler(f, nonlinear_solver='Newton')]
        
        legends = []
        for solver in solvers:
            solver.set_initial_condition(I)
            u, t = solver.solve(t)
        
            plt.plot(t, u)
            plt.hold('on')
            legends.append(solver.__class__.__name__)
        
        # Compare with exact solution plotted on a very fine mesh
        t_fine = np.linspace(0, T, 10001)
        u_e = I*np.exp(-a*t_fine)
        plt.plot(t_fine, u_e, '-') # avoid markers by specifying line type
        legends.append('exact')
        
        plt.legend(legends)
        plt.title('Time step: %g' % dt)
        plt.show()

This code might deserve a couple of comments. We use SciTools for
plotting, because with the Matplotlib and Gnuplot backends, curves are
automatically given colors *and* markers, the latter being important
when PNG plots are printed in reports in black and white. (The default
Matplotlib and Gnuplot behavior gives colored lines, which are
difficult to distinguish. However, Gnuplot automatically introduces
different line styles if output in the Encapsulated PostScript format
is specified via ``savefig``).  The automatic adding of markers is not
suitable for a very finely resolved line, like the one for ``u_e`` in
this case, and then we specify the line type as a solid line (``-``),
leaving the color up to the backend used for plotting.  The legends
are based on the class names of the solvers, and in Python the name of
a the class type (as a string) of an object ``obj`` is obtained by
``obj.__class__.__name__``.

   *Behavior of different schemes for the decay equation*



The runs in Figure :ref:`decay:odespy:fig1`
and other experiments reveal that the 2-nd order Runge-Kutta
method (``RK2``) is unstable for :math:`\Delta t>1` and decays slower than the
Backward Euler scheme for large and moderate :math:`\Delta t` (see :ref:`decay:exer:RK2:Taylor:analysis` for an analysis).  However, for
fine :math:`\Delta t = 0.25` the 2-nd order Runge-Kutta method approaches
the exact solution faster than the Backward Euler scheme.  That is,
the latter scheme does a better job for larger :math:`\Delta t`, while the
higher order scheme is superior for smaller :math:`\Delta t`. This is a
typical trend also when solving many other ordinary and partial
differential equations.

The 3-rd order Runge-Kutta method (``RK3``) has also artifacts in form
of oscillatory behavior for the larger :math:`\Delta t` values, much
like that of the Crank-Nicolson scheme. For finer :math:`\Delta t`,
the 3-rd order Runge-Kutta method converges quickly to the exact
solution.

The 4-th order Runge-Kutta method (``RK4``) is slightly inferior
to the Backward Euler scheme on the coarsest mesh, but is then
clearly superior to all the other schemes. It is definitely the
method of choice for all the tested schemes.


Remark about using the :math:`\theta`-rule in Odespy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Odespy package assumes that the ODE is written as :math:`u'=f(u,t)` with
an :math:`f` that is possibly nonlinear in :math:`u`. The :math:`\theta`-rule for
:math:`u'=f(u,t)` leads to

.. math::
         u^{n+1} = u^{n} + \Delta t\left(\theta f(u^{n+1}, t_{n+1})
        + (1-\theta) f(u^{n}, t_{n})\right),

which is a *nonlinear equation* in :math:`u^{n+1}`. Odespy's implementation
of the :math:`\theta`-rule (``ThetaRule``) and the specialized Backward Euler
and Crank-Nicolson schemes (called ``BackwardEuler`` and
``MidpointImplicit``, respectively) must invoke iterative methods for
solving the nonlinear equation in :math:`u^{n+1}`. This is done even when
:math:`f` is linear in :math:`u`, as in the model problem :math:`u'=-au`, where we can
easily solve for :math:`u^{n+1}`.  In the present example, we need to use
Newton's method to ensure that Odespy is capable of solving the
equation for :math:`u^{n+1}` for large :math:`\Delta t`. (The reason is that the
Forward Euler method is used to compute the initial guess for the
nonlinear iteration method, and this Forward Euler may give very wrong
values for large :math:`\Delta t`.  The Newton method is not sensitive to a
bad initial guess in linear problems.)


Example: Adaptive Runge-Kutta methods
-------------------------------------

Odespy offers solution methods that can adapt the size of :math:`\Delta t`
with time to match a desired accuracy in the solution. Intuitively,
small time steps will be chosen in areas where the solution is changing
rapidly, while larger time steps can be used where the solution
is slowly varying. Some kind of *error estimator* is used to
adjust the next time step at each time level.

A very popular adaptive method for solving ODEs is the Dormand-Prince
Runge-Kutta method of order 4 and 5. The 5th-order method is used as a
reference solution and the difference between the 4th- and 5th-order
methods is used as an indicator of the error in the numerical
solution.  The Dormand-Prince method is the default choice in MATLAB's
famous ``ode45`` routine.

We can easily set up Odespy to use the Dormand-Prince method and
see how it selects the optimal time steps. To this end, we request
only one time step from :math:`t=0` to :math:`t=T` and ask the method to
compute the necessary non-uniform time mesh to meet a certain
error tolerance. The code goes like


.. code-block:: python

        import odespy
        import numpy as np
        import dc_mod
        import sys
        #import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import scitools.std as plt
        
        def f(u, t):
            return -a*u
        
        def exact_solution(t):
            return I*np.exp(-a*t)
        
        I = 1; a = 2; T = 5
        tol = float(sys.argv[1])
        solver = odespy.DormandPrince(f, atol=tol, rtol=0.1*tol)
        
        N = 1  # just one step - let the scheme find its intermediate points
        t_mesh = np.linspace(0, T, N+1)
        t_fine = np.linspace(0, T, 10001)
        
        solver.set_initial_condition(I)
        u, t = solver.solve(t_mesh)
        
        # u and t will only consist of [I, u^N] and [0,T]
        # solver.u_all and solver.t_all contains all computed points
        plt.plot(solver.t_all, solver.u_all, 'ko')
        plt.hold('on')
        plt.plot(t_fine, exact_solution(t_fine), 'b-')
        plt.legend(['tol=%.0E' % tol, 'exact'])
        plt.savefig('tmp_odespy_adaptive.png')
        plt.show()


Running four cases with tolerances :math:`10^{-1}`, :math:`10^{-3}`, :math:`10^{-5}`,
and :math:`10^{-7}`, gives the results in Figure :ref:`decay:odespy:fig2`.
Intuitively, one would expect denser points in the beginning of
the decay and larger time steps when the solution flattens out.

   *Choice of adaptive time mesh by the Dormand-Prince method for different tolerances*



Other schemes
-------------

Next we list some well-known methods for :math:`u'=f(u,t)`, valid both for
a single ODE (scalar :math:`u`) and systems of ODEs (vector :math:`u`).


.. index::
   single: backward scheme, 2-step

.. index:: BDF2 scheme


Implicit 2-step backward scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The implicit backward method with 2 steps applies a
three-level backward difference as approximation to :math:`u'(t)`,

.. math::
         u'(t_{n+1}) \approx \frac{3u^{n+1} - 4u^{n} + u^{n-1}}{2\Delta t},

which is an approximation of order :math:`\Delta t^2` to the first derivative.
The resulting scheme for :math:`u'=f(u,t)` reads

.. math::
   :label: decay:fd2:bw:2step
         u^{n+1} = \frac{4}{3}u^n - \frac{1}{3}u^{n-1} +
        \frac{2}{3}\Delta t f(u^{n+1}, t_{n+1})
        \thinspace .
        
        

Higher-order versions of the scheme :eq:`decay:fd2:bw:2step` can
be constructed by including more time levels. These schemes are known
as the Backward Differentiation Formulas (BDF), and the particular
version :eq:`decay:fd2:bw:2step` is often referred to as BDF2.
The family of BDF schemes are available in the solvers ``odespy.Vode``,
``odespy.Lsode``, ``odespy.Lsoda``, and ``odespy.lsoda_scipy``.

Note that the scheme :eq:`decay:fd2:bw:2step` is implicit and requires
solution of nonlinear equations when :math:`f` is nonlinear in :math:`u`.  The
standard 1st-order Backward Euler method or the Crank-Nicolson scheme
can be used for the first step.


.. index:: Leapfrog scheme


The Leapfrog scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The derivative of :math:`u` at some point :math:`t_n` can be approximated by
a central difference over two time steps,


.. math::
        
        u'(t_n)\approx \frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n-1}}{2\Delta t} = [D_{2t}u]^n
        

which is an approximation of second order in :math:`\Delta t`. The scheme
can then be written as


.. math::
         [D_{2t}=-au + b]^n, 

in operator notation. Solving for :math:`u^{n+1}` gives


.. math::
   :label: decay:fd2:leapfrog
        
        u^{n+1} = u^{n-1} + \Delta t f(u^n, t_n)
        \thinspace .
        
        

Some other scheme must be used as starter to compute :math:`u^1`.
Observe that :eq:`decay:fd2:leapfrog` is an explicit scheme, and that
a nonlinear :math:`f` (in :math:`u`) is trivial to handle since it only involves
the known :math:`u^n` value.


.. index::
   single: Leapfrog scheme, filtered


The filtered Leapfrog scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unfortunately, the Leapfrog scheme :eq:`decay:fd2:leapfrog`
will develop growing oscillations with time (see :ref:`decay:fd2:exer:leapfrog1`, :ref:`decay:fd2:exer:leapfrog2`, and
:ref:`decay:fd2:exer:leapfrog3`). A remedy for such undesired oscillations
is to introduce a *filtering technique*. First, a standard Leapfrog
step is taken, according to :eq:`decay:fd2:leapfrog`, and then
the previous :math:`u^n` value is adjusted according to

.. math::
   :label: decay:fd2:leapfrog:filtered
        
        u^n\ \leftarrow\ u^n + \gamma (u^{n-1} - 2u^n + u^{n+1})
        
        \thinspace .
        

The :math:`\gamma`-terms will effectively damp oscillations in the solution,
especially those with short wavelength (point-to-point oscillations in
particular). A common choice of :math:`\gamma` is 0.6 (a value used in the
famous NCAR Climate Model).

.. Need to elaborate more on this:

.. The difference in th :math:`\gamma` term in :eq:`decay:fd2:leapfrog:filtered`

.. can be recognized as a finite difference approximation to

.. :math:`\Delta t^2 u''(t_n)`.



.. index:: Heun's method


.. index::
   single: Runge-Kutta, 2nd-order scheme


2nd-order Runge-Kutta scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The two-step scheme


.. math::
        
        u^* &= u^n + \Delta t f(u^n, t_n),
        \\
        u^{n+1} &= u^n + \Delta t \frac{1}{2} \left( f(u^n, t_n) + f(u^*, t_{n+1})
        \right),
        
        

essentially applies a Crank-Nicolson method :eq:`decay:fd2:RK2:s2`
to the ODE, but replaces
the term :math:`f(u^{n+1}, t_{n+1})` by a prediction
:math:`f(u^{*}, t_{n+1})` based on a Forward Euler step :eq:`decay:fd2:RK2:s1`.
The scheme :eq:`decay:fd2:RK2:s1`-:eq:`decay:fd2:RK2:s2` is
known as Huen's method, but is also a 2nd-order Runge-Kutta method.
The scheme is explicit, and the error is expected to behave as :math:`\Delta t^2`.


.. index:: Taylor-series methods (for ODEs)


A 2nd-order Taylor-series method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One way to compute :math:`u^{n+1}` given :math:`u^n` is to use a Taylor polynomial.
We may write up a polynomial of 2nd degree:

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} = u^n + u'(t_n)\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}u''(t_n)\Delta t^2
        \thinspace .
        

From the equation :math:`u'=f(u,t)` it follows that the derivatives of :math:`u`
can be expressed in terms of :math:`f` and its derivatives:

.. math::
        
        u'(t_n)=f(u^n,t_n),\quad u''(t_n)=
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial u}(u^n,t_n) u'(t_n) + \frac{partial f}{\partial t} =
         f(u^n,t_n)\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}(u^n,t_n)  + \frac{partial f}{\partial t},
        

resulting in the scheme

.. math::
   :label: decay:fd2:Taylor2
        
        u^{n+1} = u^n + f(u^n,t_n)\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}\left(
        f(u^n,t_n)\frac{\partial f}{\partial u}(u^n,t_n)  +
        \frac{partial f}{\partial t}\right)\Delta t^2
        \thinspace .
        
        

More terms in the series could be included in the Taylor polynomial to
obtain methods of higher order.



.. index::
   single: Adams-Bashforth scheme, 2nd order


2nd-order Adams-Bashforth scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following method is known as the 2nd-order Adams-Bashforth scheme:


.. math::
   :label: decay:fd2:AB2
        
        u^{n+1} = u^n + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t\left( 3f(u^n, t_n) - f(u^{n-1}, t_{n-1})
        \right)
        \thinspace .
        
        

The scheme is explicit and requires another one-step scheme to compute
:math:`u^1` (the Forward Euler scheme or Heun's method, for instance).
As the name implies, the scheme is of order :math:`\Delta t^2`.

Exercise 14: Implement the 2-step backward scheme
-------------------------------------------------

Implement the 2-step backward method :eq:`decay:fd2:bw:2step` for the
model :math:`u'(t) = -a(t)u(t) + b(t)`, :math:`u(0)=I`.  Allow the first step to
be computed by either the Backward Euler scheme or the Crank-Nicolson
scheme. Verify the implementing by choosing :math:`a(t)` and :math:`b(t)` such
that the exact solution is linear in :math:`t` (see the section :ref:`decay:MMS`). Show mathematically that a linear solution is a
solution of the discrete equations.

Compute convergence rates (see the section :ref:`decay:convergence:rate`) in
a test case :math:`a=\hbox{const}` and :math:`b=0`, where we easily have an exact

the exact solution is linear in :math:`t` (see the section :ref:`decay:MMS`).

Compute convergence rates (see the section :ref:`decay:convergence:rate`)

A possible test case is
:math:`u'=-au + b`, :math:`u(0)=0`, where :math:`u_{\small\mbox{e}}(t)=b/a + (I - b/a)e^{-at}` if

Applications of exponential decay models
========================================

This section presents many mathematical models that all
end up with ODEs of the type :math:`u'=-au+b`, where the solution exhibits
exponential growth or decay.  The applications are taken from biology,
finance, and physics, and cover population growth or decay, compound
interest and inflation, radioactive decay, cooling of bodies, pressure
variations in the atmosphere, and air resistance on falling or rising
bodies.



.. _decay:app:pop:

Evolution of a population
-------------------------


.. index:: population dynamics


Let :math:`N` be the number of individuals in a population occupying some
spatial domain.
Despite :math:`N` being an integer we shall compute with :math:`N` as a real number
and view :math:`N(t)` as a continuous function of time.
The basic model assumption is that in a time interval :math:`\Delta t` the number of
newcomers to the populations (newborns) is proportional to
:math:`N`, with proportionality constant :math:`\bar b`. The amount of
newcomers will increase the population and result in
to

.. math::
         N(t+\Delta t) = N(t) + \bar bN(t)\thinspace . 

It is obvious that a long time interval :math:`\Delta t` will result in
more newcomers and hence a larger :math:`\bar b`. Therefore, we introduce
:math:`b=\bar b/\Delta t`: the number of newcomers per unit time and per
individual. We must then multiply :math:`b` by the length of the time
interval considered and by the population size to get the
total number of new individuals, :math:`b\Delta t N`.

If the number of removals from the population (deaths) is also
proportional to :math:`N`, with proportionality constant :math:`d\Delta t`,
the population evolves according to

.. math::
         N(t+\Delta t) = N(t) + b\Delta t N(t) - d\Delta t N(t)\thinspace . 

Dividing by :math:`\Delta t` and letting :math:`\Delta t \rightarrow 0`,
we get the ODE


.. math::
        
        N' = (b-d)N\thinspace .
        

In a population where the death rate (:math:`d`) is larger than
then newborn rate (:math:`b`), :math:`a>0`, and the population experiences
exponential decay rather than exponential growth.

In some populations there is an immigration of individuals into the
spatial domain. With :math:`I` individuals coming in per time unit,
the equation for the population change becomes


.. math::
         N(t+\Delta t) = N(t) + b\Delta t N(t) - d\Delta t N(t) + \Delta t I\thinspace . 

The corresponding ODE reads

.. math::
        
        N' = (b-d)N + I,\quad N(0)=N_0
        \thinspace .
        


Some simplification arises if we introduce a fractional measure
of the population: :math:`u=N/N_0` and set :math:`r=b-d`. The ODE problem
now becomes

.. math::
   :label: decay:app:pop:ueq
        
        u' = ru + f,\quad u(0)=1,
        
        

where :math:`f=I/N_0` measures the net immigration per time unit as
the fraction of the initial population.


.. index:: logistic model


The growth rate :math:`r` of a population decreases if the environment
has limited resources. Suppose the environment can sustain at
most :math:`N_{\max}` individuals. We may then assume that the growth rate
approaches zero as :math:`N` approaches :math:`N_{\max}`, i.e., as :math:`u` approaches
:math:`M=N_{\max}/N_0`. The simplest possible evolution of :math:`r` is then a
linear function: :math:`r(t)=r_0(1-u(t)/M)`, where :math:`r_0`
is the initial growth rate when the population is small relative to the
maximum size and there is enough resources. Using this :math:`r(t)` in
:eq:`decay:app:pop:ueq` results in the *logistic model* for the
evolution of a population:

.. math::
   :label: decay:app:pop:logistic
        
        u' = r_0(1-u/M)u,\quad u(0)=1
        \thinspace .
        
        

Initially, :math:`u` will grow at rate :math:`r_0`, but the growth will decay
as :math:`u` approaches :math:`M`, and then there is no more change in :math:`u`, causing
the limit :math:`u\rightarrow M` as :math:`t\rightarrow\infty`.
Note that the logistic equation :math:`u'=r_0(1-u/M)u` is *nonlinear* because
of the quadratic term :math:`-u^2r_0/M`.

.. _decay:app:interest:

Compound interest and inflation
-------------------------------

Say the annual interest rate is :math:`r` percent and that the bank
adds the interest once a year to your investment.
If :math:`u^n` is the investment in year :math:`n`, the investment in year :math:`u^{n+1}`
grows to


.. math::
         u^{n+1} = u^n + \frac{r}{100}u^n
        \thinspace . 

In reality, the interest rate is added every day. We therefore introduce
a parameter :math:`m` for the number of periods per year when the interest
is added. If :math:`n` counts the periods, we have the fundamental model
for compound interest:

.. math::
   :label: decay:app:interest:eq1
        
        u^{n+1} = u^n + \frac{r}{100 m}u^n
        \thinspace .
        
        

This model is a *difference equation*, but it can be transformed to a
continuous differential equation through a limit process.
The first step is to derive a formula for the growth of the investment
over a time :math:`t`.
Starting with an investment :math:`u^0`, and assuming that :math:`r` is constant in time,
we get

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} &= \left(1 + \frac{r}{100 m}\right)u^{n}\\
        &= \left(1 + \frac{r}{100 m}\right)^2u^{n-1}\\
        &\ \ \vdots\\
        &= \left(1 +\frac{r}{100 m}\right)^{n+1}u^{0}
        

Introducing time :math:`t`, which here is a real-numbered counter for years,
we have that :math:`n=mt`, so we can write


.. math::
         u^{mt} = \left(1 + \frac{r}{100 m}\right)^{mt} u^0\thinspace . 

The second step is to assume *continuous compounding*, meaning that the
interest is added continuously. This implies :math:`m\rightarrow\infty`, and
in the limit one gets the formula

.. math::
        
        u(t) = u_0e^{rt/100},
        

which is nothing but the solution of the ODE problem

.. math::
   :label: decay:app:interest:eq2
        
        u' = \frac{r}{100}u,\quad u(0)=u_0
        \thinspace .
        
        

This is then taken as the ODE model for compound interest if :math:`r>0`.
However, the reasoning applies equally well to inflation, which is
just the case :math:`r<0`. One may also take the :math:`r` in :eq:`decay:app:interest:eq2`
as the net growth of an investemt, where :math:`r` takes both compound interest
and inflation into account. Note that for real applications we must
use a time-dependent :math:`r` in :eq:`decay:app:interest:eq2`.


Introducing :math:`a=\frac{r}{100}`, continuous inflation of an initial
fortune :math:`I` is then
a process exhibiting exponential decay according to

.. math::
         u' = -au,\quad u(0)=I\thinspace . 



Radioactive Decay
-----------------


.. index:: radioactive decay


An atomic nucleus of an unstable atom may lose energy by emitting
ionizing particles and thereby be transformed to a nucleus with a
different number of protons and neutrons.  This process is known as
`radioactive decay <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay>`_.
Actually, the process is stochastic when viewed for a single atom,
because it is impossible to predict exactly when a particular atom
emits a particle. Nevertheless, with a large number of atoms, :math:`N`, one may
view the process as deterministic and compute the mean behavior
of the decay.

Suppose at time :math:`t`, the number of the original atom type is :math:`N(t)`.
A basic model assumption is that the transformation of the atoms of the original
type in a small time interval :math:`\Delta t` is proportional to
:math:`N`, so that

.. math::
         N(t+\Delta t) = N(t) - a\Delta t N(t),

where :math:`a` is a constant. Introducing :math:`u=N(t)/N(0)`, dividing by
:math:`\Delta t` and letting :math:`\Delta t\rightarrow 0` gives the
following ODE:


.. math::
        
        u' = -au,\quad u(0)=1
        \thinspace .
        

The parameter :math:`a` can for a given nucleus be expressed through the
*half-life* :math:`t_{1/2}`, which is the time taken for the decay to reduce the
initial amount by one half, i.e., :math:`u(t_{1/2}) = 0.5`.
With :math:`u(t)=e^{-at}`, we get :math:`t_{1/2}=a^{-1}\ln 2` or :math:`a=\ln 2/t_{1/2}`.

Newton's law of cooling
-----------------------

.. http://web.bham.ac.uk/winterhs/Newton.htm

.. I. Newton, Scala Graduum Caloris, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 1701

.. explanation: http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2000-11/973522810.Ph.r.html


When a body at some temperature is placed in a cooling environment,
experience shows that the temperature falls rapidly in the beginning,
and then the changes in temperature levels off until the body's
temperature equals that of the surroundings. Newton carried out some
experiments on cooling hot iron and found that the temperature
evolved as a "geometric progression at times in arithmetic progression",
meaning that the temperature decayed exponentially.
Later, this result was formulated as a differential equation:
the rate of change of the temperature in a body is proportional to
the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings.
This statement is known as *Newton's law of cooling*, which
can be mathematically expressed as

.. math::
   :label: decay:Newton:cooling
        
        {dT\over dt} = -k(T-T_s),
        
        

where :math:`T` is the temperature of the body, :math:`T_s` is the temperature
of the surroundings, :math:`t` is time, and :math:`k` is a positive constant.
Equation :eq:`decay:Newton:cooling` is primarily viewed as an
empirical law, valid when heat is efficiently convected away
from the surface of the body by a flowing fluid such as air
at constant temperature :math:`T_s`.
The constant :math:`k` reflects the transfer of heat from the body to
the surroundings and must be determined from physical experiments.


.. _decay:app:atm:

Decay of atmospheric pressure with altitude
-------------------------------------------

.. The Barometric Formula

.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometric_formula


Vertical equilibrium of air in the atmosphere is governed by
the equation


.. math::
   :label: decay:app:atm:dpdz
        
        \frac{dp}{dz} = -\varrho g
        \thinspace .
        
        

Here, :math:`p(z)` is the air pressure, :math:`\varrho` is the density of
air, and :math:`g=9.807\hbox{ m/s}^2` is a standard value of
the acceleration of gravity.
(Equation :eq:`decay:app:atm:dpdz` follows directly from the general
Navier-Stokes equations for fluid motion, with
the assumption that the air does not move.)

The pressure is related to density and temperature through the ideal gas law


.. math::
   :label: decay:app:atm:rho
        
        \varrho = \frac{Mp}{R^*T}, 
        

where :math:`M` is the molar mass of Earth's air (0.029 kg/mol),
:math:`R^*` is the universal
gas constant (:math:`8.314` Nm/(mol K)), and :math:`T` is the temperature.
All variables :math:`p`, :math:`\varrho`, and :math:`T` vary with the height :math:`z`.
Inserting :eq:`decay:app:atm:rho` in :eq:`decay:app:atm:dpdz` results
in an ODE for with a variable coefficient:


.. math::
   :label: decay:app:atm:ode
        
        \frac{dp}{dz} = -\frac{Mg}{R^*T(z)} p
        
        \thinspace  .
        


Multiple atmospheric layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The atmosphere can be approximately modeled by seven layers.
In each layer, :eq:`decay:app:atm:ode` is applied with
a linear temperature of the form


.. math::
         T(z) = \bar T_i + L_i(z-h_i),

where :math:`z=h_i` denotes the bottom of layer number :math:`i`,
having temperature :math:`\bar T_i`,
and :math:`L_i` is a constant in layer number :math:`i`. The table below
lists :math:`h_i` (m), :math:`\bar T_i` (K), and :math:`L_i` (K/m) for the layers
:math:`i=0,\ldots,6`.

================  ================  ================  ================

0                                0               288           -0.0065  
1                           11,000               216               0.0

3                           32,000               228            0.0028  
4                           47,000               270               0.0  
5                           51,000               270           -0.0028

================  ================  ================  ================  

For implementation it might be convenient to write :eq:`decay:app:atm:ode`
on the form

.. math::
        
        \frac{dp}{dz} = -\frac{Mg}{R^*(\bar T(z) + L(z)(z-h(z)))} p,
        

where :math:`\bar T(z)`, :math:`L(z)`, and :math:`h(z)` are piecewise constant
functions with values given in the table.
The value of the pressure at the ground :math:`z=0` is :math:`101325` Pa.

Simplification: :math:`L=0`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One commonly used simplification is to assume that the temperature is
constant within each layer. This means that :math:`L=0`.

Simplification: one-layer model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another commonly used approximation is to work with one layer instead of
seven. This `one-layer model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_air>`_
is based on :math:`T(z)=T_0 - Lz`, with
sea level standard temperature :math:`T_0=288` K and

.. _decay:app:drag:

Vertical motion of a body in a viscous fluid
--------------------------------------------


A body moving vertically through a fluid (liquid or gas) is subject to
three different types of forces: the gravity force, `the drag force <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)>`_,
and the buoyancy force.

Overview of forces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The gravity force is :math:`F_g= -mg`, where :math:`m` is the mass of the body and
:math:`g` is the acceleration of gravity.
The uplift or buoyancy force ("Archimedes force") :math:`F_b = \varrho gV`,
where :math:`\varrho` is the density of the fluid and
:math:`V` is the volume of the body.
Forces and other quantities are taken as positive in the upward
direction.

The drag force is of two types, depending on the Reynolds number

.. math::
        
        \hbox{Re} = \frac{\varrho d|v|}{\mu},
        

where :math:`d` is the diameter of the body in
the direction perpendicular to the flow, :math:`v` is the velocity of the
body, and :math:`\mu` is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.
When :math:`\hbox{Re} < 1`, the drag force is fairly well modeled by
the so-called Stokes' drag,
which for a spherical body of diameter :math:`d` reads

.. math::
        
        F_d^{(S)} = - 3\pi d\mu v
        \thinspace .
        

For large Re, typically :math:`\hbox{Re} > 10^3`, the drag force is quadratic
in the velocity:

.. math::
        
        F_d^{(q)} = -{1\over2}C_D\varrho A|v|v,
        

where :math:`C_D` is a dimensionless drag coefficient depending on the body's shape,
:math:`A` is the cross-sectional area as
produced by a cut plane, perpendicular to the motion, through the thickest
part of the body. The superscripts :math:`{}^q` and :math:`{}^S` in
:math:`F_d^{(S)}` and :math:`F_d^{(q)}` indicates Stokes drag and quadratic drag,
respectively.

Equation of motion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the mentioned forces act in the vertical direction.
Newton's second law of motion applied to the body says that the sum of
these forces must equal the mass of the body times its acceleration
:math:`a` in the vertical direction.


.. math::
         ma = F_g + F_d^{(S)} + F_b ,

if we choose to work with the Stokes drag.
Inserting the expressions for the forces yields


.. math::
          ma = -mg - 3\pi d\mu v + \varrho gV
        \thinspace .
        

The unknowns here are :math:`v` and :math:`a`, i.e., we have two unknowns but only
one equation. From kinematics in physics we know that
the acceleration is the time derivative of the velocity: :math:`a = dv/dt`.
This is our second equation.
We can easily eliminate :math:`a` and get a single differential equation for :math:`v`:


.. math::
         m{dv\over dt} = -mg - 3\pi d\mu v + \varrho gV
        \thinspace .
        

A small rewrite of this equation is handy: We express :math:`m` as :math:`\varrho_bV`,
where :math:`\varrho_b` is the density of the body, and we divide by
the mass to get


.. math::
   :label: decay:app:fallingbody:model:S
        
        v'(t) = - \frac{3\pi d\mu}{\varrho_b V} v + g\left(\frac{\varrho}{\varrho_b} -1\right)
        
        \thinspace .
        

We may introduce the constants

.. math::
        
        a = \frac{3\pi d\mu}{\varrho_b V},\quad
        b = g\left(\frac{\varrho}{\varrho_b} -1\right),
        

so that the structure of the differential equation becomes evident:


.. math::
   :label: decay:app:fallingbody:gmodel:S
        
        v'(t) = -av(t) + b
        
        \thinspace .
        

The corresponding initial condition is :math:`v(0)=v_0` for some prescribed
starting velocity :math:`v_0`.

This derivation can be repeated with the quadratic drag force
:math:`F_d^{(q)}`, yielding


.. math::
   :label: decay:app:fallingbody:model:q
        
        v'(t) =
        -{1\over2}C_D{\varrho A\over\varrho_b V}|v|v +
        g\left({\varrho\over\varrho_b} - 1\right)
        \thinspace .
        
        

Defining


.. math::
        
        a = {1\over2}C_D{\varrho A\over\varrho_b V},
        

and :math:`b` as above, we can write :eq:`decay:app:fallingbody:model:q` as

.. math::
   :label: decay:app:fallingbody:gmodel:q
        
        v'(t) = -a|v|v + b
        \thinspace .
        
        



.. index:: terminal velocity


Terminal velocity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An interesting aspect of :eq:`decay:app:fallingbody:gmodel:S` and
:eq:`decay:app:fallingbody:gmodel:q` is whether we can approach
a constant, so-called *terminal velocity* :math:`v_T`, as :math:`t\rightarrow\infty`. The
existence of :math:`v_T` assumes that
:math:`v'(t)\rightarrow 0` as :math:`t\rightarrow\infty` and therefore


.. math::
        0 = -av_T + b

and

.. math::
         0 = -a|v_T|v_T + b
        \thinspace .
        

The former equation implies :math:`v_T = b/a`, while the latter has solutions
:math:`v_T =-\sqrt{|b|/a}` for a falling body (:math:`v_T<0`) and
:math:`v_T = \sqrt{b/a}` for a rising body (:math:`v_T>0`).

A Crank-Nicolson scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both governing equations, the Stokes' drag model
:eq:`decay:app:fallingbody:gmodel:S` and the quadratic drag model
:eq:`decay:app:fallingbody:gmodel:q`, can be readily solved
by the Forward Euler scheme. The Crank-Nicolson method gives
a nonlinear equation in :math:`v` when applied to
:eq:`decay:app:fallingbody:gmodel:q`:


.. math::
        
        \frac{v^{n+1}-v^n}{\Delta t}
        = -a^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\frac{1}{2}(|v^{n+1}|v^{n+1} + |v^n|v^n) + b^{n+\frac{1}{2}}
        \thinspace .
        

However, instead of approximating the term :math:`-|v|v` by an arithmetic
average, we can use a *geometric average*:


.. index:: geometric average


.. index::
   single: averaging; geometric



.. math::
        
        (|v|v)^{n+\frac{1}{2}} \approx |v^n|v^{n+1}
        \thinspace .
        

The error is of second order in :math:`\Delta t`, just as for the arithmetic
average. Now,


.. math::
        
        \frac{v^{n+1}-v^n}{\Delta t} = - a^{n+\frac{1}{2}}|v^{n}|v^{n+1} + b^{n+\frac{1}{2}}
        

becomes a linear equation in :math:`v^{n+1}`, and we can easily solve for :math:`v^{n+1}`:

.. math::
   :label: decay:app:fallingbody:gmodel:q:CN
        
        v^{n+1} = \frac{v_n + \Delta t b^{n+\frac{1}{2}}}{1 + \Delta t a^{n+\frac{1}{2}}|v^{n}|}
        
        


Physical data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suitable values of :math:`\mu` are :math:`1.8\cdot 10^{-5}\hbox{ Pa}\, \hbox{s}` for air
and :math:`8.9\cdot 10^{-4}\hbox{ Pa}\, \hbox{s}` for water.
Densities can be taken as :math:`1.2\hbox{ kg/m}^3` for air and as
:math:`1.0\cdot 10^3\hbox{ kg/m}^3` for water. For considerable vertical
displacement in the atmosphere one should take into account that
the density of air varies with height, see the section :ref:`decay:app:atm`.
One possible density variation arises from the one-layer model
in the section :ref:`decay:app:atm`.

The `drag coefficient <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient>`_ :math:`C_D` depends heavily
on the shape of the body.  Some values are: 0.45 for a sphere, 0.42
for a semi-sphere, 1.05 for a cube, 0.82 for a long cylinder (with the
length along the vertical direction), 0.75 for a rocket,
1.0-1.3 for a man in upright position, 1.3 for a flat plate perpendicular
to the flow, and
0.04 for a streamlined (droplet-like) body.

Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To verify the program, one may assume a heavy body in air such that the :math:`F_b`
force can be neglected, and assume a small velocity such that the
air resistance :math:`F_d` can also be neglected. Setting :math:`\varrho =0`
removes both these terms from the equation. The motion then leads to
the velocity
:math:`v(t)=v_0 - gt`, which is linear in :math:`t` and therefore should be
reproduced to machine precision (say tolerance :math:`10^{-15}`) by any
implementation based on the Crank-Nicolson or Forward Euler schemes.

Another verification, but not as powerful as the one above,
can be based on computing the terminal velocity and comparing with
the exact expressions.



.. _decay:app:diffusion:Fourier:

Decay ODEs from solving a PDE by Fourier expansions
---------------------------------------------------

.. Maybe move to diffusion part? Makes sense there two, or refer...or

.. repeat, or make one exer with two k's and then generalize in diffusion


Suppose we have a partial differential equation

.. math::
         \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}
        + f(x,t),
        

with boundary conditions :math:`u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0` and initial condition
:math:`u(x,0)=I(x)`. One may express the solution as

.. math::
         u(x,t) = \sum_{k=1}^m A_k(t)e^{ikx\pi/L},

for appropriate unknown functions :math:`A_k`, :math:`k=1,\ldots,m`.
We use the complex exponential :math:`e^{ikx\pi/L}` for easy algebra, but
the physical :math:`u` is taken as the real part of any complex expression.
Note that the expansion in terms of :math:`e^{ikx\pi/L}` is compatible with
the boundary conditions: all functions :math:`e^{ikx\pi/L}` vanish for
:math:`x=0` and :math:`x=L`. Suppose we can express :math:`I(x)` as


.. math::
         I(x) = \sum_{k=1}^m I_ke^{ikx\pi/L},
        \thinspace .
        

Such an expansion can be computed by well-known Fourier expansion techniques,
but the details are not important here.
Also suppose we can express the given :math:`f(x,t)` as

.. math::
         f(x,t) = \sum_{k=1}^m b_k(t)e^{ikx\pi/L}
        \thinspace .
        

Inserting the expansions for :math:`u`
and :math:`f` in the differential equations demands that all terms corresponding
to a given :math:`k` must be equal. The calculations results in the follow
system of ODEs:


.. math::
        
        A_k'(t) = -\alpha\frac{k^2\pi^2}{L^2} + b_k(t),\quad k=1,\ldots,m
        \thinspace .
        

From the initial condition

.. math::
         u(x,0)=\sum_k A_k(0)e^{ikx\pi/L}=I(x)=\sum_k I_k\pmb{e}^{(ikx\pi/L)},

it follows that :math:`A_k(0)=I_k`, :math:`k=1,\ldots,m`. We then have :math:`m`
equations of the form :math:`A_k'=-a A_k +b`, :math:`A_k(0)=I_k`, for
appropriate definitions of :math:`a` and :math:`b`. These ODE problems
independent each other such that we can solve one problem
at a time. The outline technique is a quite common approach for solving
partial differential equations.

*Remark.* Since :math:`a=\alpha k^2\pi^2/L^2` depends on :math:`k` and the stability of
the Forward Euler scheme demands :math:`a\Delta t \leq 1`, we get that
:math:`\Delta t \leq \alpha^{-1}L^2\pi^{-2} k^{-2}`. Usually, quite large
:math:`k` values are needed to accurately represent the given functions
:math:`I(x)` and :math:`f(x,y)` and then :math:`\Delta t` needs to be very small.
Therefore, the Crank-Nicolson and Backward Euler schemes, which
allow larger :math:`\Delta t` without any growth in the solutions, are
more popular choices when creating time-stepping algorithms for
partial differential equations.

Set the density of the human body

Exercise 28: Simulate a complete parachute jump
-----------------------------------------------

A parachute jumper moves a vertical distance of about 5000 m where

Moreover, the density of air changes with altitude.
Add a differential equation for the altitude :math:`z`,


.. math::
        
        z'(t) = v(t),
        

and a differential equation for the air density, based on
the information for the one-layer atmospheric model in
the section :ref:`decay:app:atm`:


.. math::
        
        p'(z) &= -\frac{Mg}{R^*(T_0+Lz)} p,\\
        \varrho &= p \frac{M}{R^*T}
        \thinspace .
        


Extend the program from :ref:`decay:app:exer:drag:prog` to
handle three coupled differential equations. With the Crank-Nicolson
method, one must solve a :math:`3\times 3` system of equations at each time
level, since :math:`p` depends on :math:`z`, which depends on :math:`v`, which depends
on :math:`\varrho`, which depends on :math:`p`.  Switching to the Forward Euler
method avoids the need to solve coupled equations, but demands smaller
:math:`\Delta t` for accuracy. Make sure :math:`A` and :math:`C_D` can be changed at
some time :math:`t_p` when the parachute is released.

Exercise 35: Simulate growth of a fortune with random interest rate

The goal of this exercise is to compute the value of a fortune subject
to inflation and a random interest rate.
Suppose that the inflation is constant at :math:`i` percent per year and that the
annual interest rate, :math:`p`, changes randomly at each time step,
starting at some value :math:`p_0` at :math:`t=0`.
The random change is from a value :math:`p^n` at :math:`t=t_n` to
:math:`p_n +\Delta p` with probability 0.25 and :math:`p_n -\Delta p` with probability 0.25.
No change occurs with probability 0.5. There is also no change if
:math:`p^{n+1}` exceeds 15 or becomes below 1.

*Hint 2.* If :math:`u_i(t)` is the value of the fortune in experiment number :math:`i`,
:math:`i=0,\ldots,N-1`,
the mean evolution of the fortune is

.. math::
         \bar u(t)= \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} u_i(t),
        

and the standard deviation is

.. math::
         s(t) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1}\left(- (\bar u(t))^2 +
                        \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (u_i(t))^2\right)}
        \thinspace .
        

Suppose :math:`u_i(t)` is stored in an array ``u``.
The mean and the standard deviation of the fortune
is most efficiently computed by
using to accumulation arrays, ``sum_u`` and ``sum_u2``, and
performing ``sum_u += u`` and ``sum_u2 += u**2`` after every experiment.
This technique avoids storing all the :math:`u_i(t)` time series for
computing the statistics.

.. _decay:app:exer:pop:at:

Exercise 36: Simulate sudden environmental changes for a population
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We shall study a population modeled by :eq:`decay:app:pop:ueq` where
the environment, represented by :math:`r` and :math:`f`, undergoes changes with time.
Assume that there is a sudden drop (increase) in the birth (death)
rate at time :math:`t=t_r`,
because of limited nutrition or food supply:

.. math::
         a(t) =\left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        r_0, & t< t_r,\\
        r_0 - A, & t\geq t_r,\end{array}\right.
        

This drop in population growth is compensated by a sudden net immigration
at time :math:`t_f>t_r`:

.. math::
         f(t) =\left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        0, & t< t_f,\\
        f_0, & t\geq t_a,\end{array}\right.
        

Start with :math:`r_0` and make :math:`A>r_0`. Experiment these and other parameters to
illustrate the interplay of growth and decay in such a problem.

.. _decay:app:exer:pop:osc:

Exercise 37: Simulate oscillating environment for a population
--------------------------------------------------------------

This exercise is a variant of :ref:`decay:app:exer:pop:at`.
Now we assume that the environmental conditions changes periodically with
time so that we may take

.. math::
         r(t) = r_0 + A\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{P}t\right)
        \thinspace .
        

That is, the combined birth and death rate oscillates around :math:`r_0` with
a maximum change of :math:`\pm A` repeating over a period of length :math:`P` in time.
Set :math:`f=0` and experiment with the other parameters to illustrate typical
features of the solution.

.. _decay:app:exer:pop:logistic1:

Exercise 38: Simulate logistic growth
-------------------------------------

Solve the logistic ODE
:eq:`decay:app:pop:logistic` using a Crank-Nicolson scheme where
:math:`(u^{n+1/2})^2` is approximated by a *geometric mean*:

.. math::
         (u^{n+1/2})^2 \approx u^{n+1}u^n
        \thinspace .
        

This trick makes the discrete equation linear in :math:`u^{n+1}`.

.. _decay:app:exer:interest:derive:

Exercise 39: Rederive the equation for continuous compound interest
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The ODE model :eq:`decay:app:interest:eq2` was derived under the assumption
that :math:`r` was constant. Perform an alternative derivation without
this assumption: 1) start with :eq:`decay:app:interest:eq1`;
2) introduce a time step :math:`\Delta t` instead of :math:`m`: :math:`\Delta t = 1/m` if
:math:`t` is measured in years; 3) divide by :math:`\Delta t` and take the
limit :math:`\Delta t\rightarrow 0`. Simulate a case where the inflation is
at a constant level :math:`I` percent per year and the interest rate oscillates
around :math:`I/2 + r_0\sin(2\pi t)`, giving :math:`r=-I/2 + r_0\sin(2\pi t)`.
Compare solutions for :math:`r_0=I, 3I/2, 2I`.
