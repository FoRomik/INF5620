Basic finite element methods
============================

:Author: Hans Petter Langtangen

:Date: Oct 30, 2012

Note: **QUITE PRELIMINARY VERSION**







The finite element method is a powerful tool for solving differential
equations, especially in complicated domains and where higher-order
approximations are desired. Figure :ref:`fem:motivation:fig:dolfin` shows
a two-dimensional domain with a non-trivial geometry. The idea is to
divide the domain into triangles (elements) and seek a polynomial approximations
to the unknown functions on each triangle. The method glues these
piecewise approximations together to find a global solution.
Linear and quadratic polynomials over the triangles are particularly
popular.

.. ========= Principles and machinery for approximating functions =========



Many successful numerical methods for differential equations,
including the finite element method,
aim at approximating the unknown function by a sum


.. math::
   :label: fem:u
        
         u(x) = \sum_{i=0}^N c_i\varphi_i(x),
        
        

where :math:`\varphi_i(x)` are prescribed functions and :math:`c_i`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`,
are unknown coefficients to be determined.
Solution methods for differential equations
utilizing :eq:`fem:u` must
have a *principle* for constructing :math:`N+1` equations to
determine :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`. Then there is a *machinery* regarding
the actual constructions of the equations for :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` in a
particular problem. Finally, there is a *solve* phase for computing
the solution :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` of the :math:`N+1` equations.

Especially in the finite element method, the machinery for constructing
the discrete equations to be implemented on a computer is quite
comprehensive, with many mathematical and implementational
details entering the scene at the
same time. From an ease-of-learning perspective it can therefore be
wise to introduce the computational machinery for a trivial equation:
:math:`u=f`. Solving this equation with :math:`f` given and :math:`u` on the form
:eq:`fem:u` means that we seek an approximation
:math:`u` to :math:`f`.
This approximation problem has the advantage of introducing most of the
finite element toolbox, but with postponing demanding topics related to
differential equations (e.g., integration by parts, boundary conditions,
and coordinate mappings).
This is the reason why we shall first become familiar
with finite element *approximation* before addressing
finite element methods for differential equations.

First, we refresh some linear algebra concepts about approximating
vectors in vector spaces. Second, we extend these concepts to
approximating functions in function spaces, using the same
principles and the same notation.
We present examples on approximating functions by  global basis functions with
support throughout the entire domain.
Third, we introduce the finite element type of local basis functions
and explain the computational algorithms for working with such functions.
Three types of approximation principles are covered: 1) the least squares
method, 2) the Galerkin method, and 3) interpolation or collocation.

.. _fem:approx:vec:

Approximation of vectors
========================

We shall start with introducing two fundamental methods for
determining the coefficients :math:`c_i` in :eq:`fem:u` and illustrate
the methods on approximation of vectors, because vectors in vector
spaces is more intuitive than working with functions in function spaces.
The extension from vectors to functions will be trivial as soon as
the fundamental ideas are understood.

The first method of approximation is called the *least squares method*
and consists in finding :math:`c_i` such that the difference :math:`u-f`, measured
in some norm, is minimized. That is, we aim at finding the best
approximation :math:`u` to :math:`f` (in some norm). The second method is not
as intuitive: we find :math:`u` such that the error :math:`u-f` is orthogonal to
the space where we seek :math:`u`. This is known as a *Galerkin method*
when the principle is used to solve differential equations, but it
applies to the trivial equation :math:`u=f`, i.e., approximation as well.
When approximating vectors and functions, the two methods are
equivalent, but this is no longer the case when working with differential
equations.

Approximation of planar vectors
-------------------------------

   single: approximation; of vectors in the plane



Suppose we have given a vector :math:`\pmb{f} = (3,5)` in the :math:`xy` plane
and that we want to approximate this vector by a vector aligned
in the direction of the vector :math:`(a,b)`. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:vec:plane:fig`
depicts the situation.


.. _fem:approx:vec:plane:fig:

.. figure:: fig-fem/vecapprox_plane.png
   :width: 400

   *Approximation of a two-dimensional vector by a one-dimensional vector*


We introduce the vector space :math:`V`
spanned by the vector :math:`\pmb{\varphi}_0=(a,b)`:


.. math::
        
        V = \mbox{span}\,\{ \pmb{\varphi}_0\}\thinspace . 

We say that :math:`\pmb{\varphi}_0` is a basis vector in the space :math:`V`.
Our aim is to find the vector :math:`\pmb{u} = c_0\pmb{\varphi}_0\in V` which best approximates
the given vector :math:`\pmb{f} = (3,5)`. A reasonable criterion for a best
approximation could be to minimize the length of the difference between
the approximate :math:`\pmb{u}` and the given :math:`\pmb{f}`. The difference, or error,
:math:`\pmb{e} = \pmb{f} -\pmb{u}` has its length given by the *norm*


.. math::
         ||\pmb{e}|| = (\pmb{e},\pmb{e})^{\frac{1}{2}},

where :math:`(\pmb{e},\pmb{e})` is the *inner product* of :math:`\pmb{e}` and itself. The inner
product, also called *scalar product* or *dot product*, of two vectors
:math:`\pmb{u}=(u_0,u_1)` and :math:`\pmb{v} =(v_0,v_1)` is defined as


.. math::
        
        (\pmb{u}, \pmb{v}) = u_0v_0 + u_1v_1\thinspace . 


*Remark.* We should point out that we use the notation
:math:`(\cdot,\cdot)` for two different things:
:math:`(a,b)` for scalar quantities :math:`a` and :math:`b` means the vector starting in
the origin and ending in the point :math:`(a,b)`, while :math:`(\pmb{u},\pmb{v})` with
vectors :math:`\pmb{u}` and :math:`\pmb{v}` means the inner product of these vectors.
Since vectors are here written in boldface font there should be no
confusion.
Note that the norm associated with this inner product is the usual Eucledian length
of a vector.

   single: least squreas method; vectors


The least squares method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now want to find :math:`c_0` such that it minimizes :math:`||\pmb{e}||`. The algebra
is simplified if we minimize the square of the norm, :math:`||\pmb{e}||^2 = (\pmb{e}, \pmb{e})`.
Define


.. math::
        
        E(c_0) = (\pmb{e},\pmb{e}) = (\pmb{f} - c_0\pmb{\varphi}_0, \pmb{f} - c_0\pmb{\varphi}_0)
        \thinspace .
        

We can rewrite the expressions of the right-hand side to a more
convenient form for further work:


.. math::
   :label: fem:vec:E
        
        E(c_0) = (\pmb{f},\pmb{f}) - 2c_0(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_0) + c_0^2(\pmb{\varphi}_0,\pmb{\varphi}_0)\thinspace .
        
        

The rewrite results from using the following fundamental rules for inner
product spaces\footnote{It might be wise to refresh some basic linear algebra
by consulting a textbook.
:ref:`fem:approx:fe:exer:linalg1` and :ref:`fem:approx:fe:exer:linalg2` suggest specific tasks
to regain familiarity with fundamental operations on inner product
vector spaces.}:


.. math::
        
        (\alpha\pmb{u},\pmb{v})=\alpha(\pmb{u},\pmb{v}),\quad \alpha\in\mathbb{R},
        



.. math::
        
        (\pmb{u} +\pmb{v},\pmb{w}) = (\pmb{u},\pmb{w}) + (\pmb{v}, \pmb{w}),
        



.. math::
        
        (\pmb{u}, \pmb{v}) = (\pmb{v}, \pmb{u})\thinspace . 


Minimizing :math:`E(c_0)` implies finding :math:`c_0` such that


.. math::
         \frac{\partial E}{\partial c_0} = 0\thinspace . 

Differentiating :eq:`fem:vec:E` with respect to :math:`c_0` gives


.. math::
   :label: fem:vec:dEdc0:v1
        
        \frac{\partial E}{\partial c_0} = -2(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_0) + 2c_0 (\pmb{\varphi}_0,\pmb{\varphi}_0)
        \thinspace .
        
        

Setting the above expression equal to zero and solving for :math:`c_0` gives


.. math::
   :label: fem:vec:c0
        
        c_0 = \frac{(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_0)}{(\pmb{\varphi}_0,\pmb{\varphi}_0)},
        
        

which in the present case with :math:`\pmb{\varphi}_0=(a,b)` results in


.. math::
        
        c_0 = \frac{3a + 5b}{a^2 + b^2}\thinspace . 


For later, it is worth mentioning that setting
the key equation :eq:`fem:vec:dEdc0:v1` to zero can be rewritten
as


.. math::
        
        (\pmb{f}-c0\pmb{\varphi}_0,\pmb{\varphi}_0) = 0,
        

or


.. math::
   :label: fem:vec:dEdc0:Galerkin
        
        (\pmb{e}, \pmb{\varphi}_0) = 0
        \thinspace .
        
        






.. index::
   single: Galerkin method; vectors


The Galerkin method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minimizing :math:`||\pmb{e}||^2` implies that :math:`\pmb{e}` is
orthogonal to *any* vector :math:`\pmb{v}` in the space :math:`V`. This result is
visually quite clear from Figure :ref:`fem:vecapprox:fig` (think of
other vectors along the line :math:`(a,b)`: all of them will lead to
a larger distance between the approximation and :math:`\pmb{f}`).
To see this result mathematically, we
express any :math:`\pmb{v}\in V` as :math:`\pmb{v}=s\pmb{\varphi}_0` for any scalar parameter :math:`s`,
recall that two vectors are orthogonal when their inner product vanishes,
and calculate the inner product

.. math::
        
        (\pmb{e}, s\pmb{\varphi}_0) &= (\pmb{f} - c_0\pmb{\varphi}_0, s\pmb{\varphi}_0)\\
        &= (\pmb{f},s\pmb{\varphi}_0) - (c_0\pmb{\varphi}_0, s\pmb{\varphi}_0)\\
        &= s(\pmb{f},s\pmb{\varphi}_0) - sc_0(\pmb{\varphi}_0, s\pmb{\varphi}_0)\\
        &= s(\pmb{f},s\pmb{\varphi}_0) - s\frac{(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_0)}{(\pmb{\varphi}_0,\pmb{\varphi}_0)}(\pmb{\varphi}_0,\pmb{\varphi}_0)\\
        &= s\left( (\pmb{f},s\pmb{\varphi}_0) - (\pmb{f},s\pmb{\varphi}_0)\right)\\
        &=0\thinspace .
        

Therefore, instead of minimizing the square of the norm, we could
demand that :math:`\pmb{e}` is orthogonal to any vector in :math:`V`.
This is called Galerkin's method and stated mathematically as the
equation


.. math::
   :label: fem:vec:Galerkin1
        
        (\pmb{e}, \pmb{v}) = 0,\quad\forall\pmb{v}\in V\thinspace .
        
        

Since an arbitrary :math:`\pmb{v}\in V` can be expressed as
:math:`s\pmb{\varphi}_0`, :math:`s\in\mathbb{R}`,
:eq:`fem:vec:Galerkin1` implies


.. math::
         (\pmb{e},s\pmb{\varphi}_0) = s(\pmb{e}, \pmb{\varphi}_0) = 0,

which means that the error must be orthogonal to the basis vector in
the space :math:`V`:


.. math::
        
        (\pmb{e}, \pmb{\varphi}_0)=0\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
        (\pmb{f} - c_0\pmb{\varphi}_0, \pmb{\varphi}_0)=0
        \thinspace .
        

The latter equation gives :eq:`fem:vec:c0` for :math:`c_0`.
Furthermore, the latter equation also arose
from least squares computations in
:eq:`fem:vec:dEdc0:Galerkin`.




.. _fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:

Approximation of general vectors
--------------------------------

.. index::
   single: approximation; of general vectors



Let us generalize the vector approximation from the previous section
to vectors in spaces with arbitrary dimension. Given some vector :math:`\pmb{f}`,
we want to find the best approximation to this vector in
the space


.. math::
        
        V = \hbox{span}\,\{\pmb{\varphi}_0,\ldots,\pmb{\varphi}_N\}
        \thinspace .
        

We assume that the *basis vectors* :math:`\pmb{\varphi}_0,\ldots,\pmb{\varphi}_N` are
linearly independent so that none of them are redundant and
the space has dimension :math:`N+1`.
Any vector :math:`\pmb{u}\in V` can be written as a linear combination
of the basis vectors,


.. math::
         \pmb{u} = \sum_{j=0}^Nc_j\pmb{\varphi}_j,

where :math:`c_j\in\mathbb{R}` are scalar coefficients to be determined.

The least squares method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we want to find :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` such that :math:`\pmb{u}` is the best
approximation to :math:`\pmb{f}` in the sense that the distance, or error,
:math:`\pmb{e} = \pmb{f} - \pmb{u}` is minimized. Again, we define
the squared distance as a function of the free parameters
:math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`,


.. math::
   :label: fem:vec:genE
        
        E(c_0,\ldots,c_N) &= (\pmb{e},\pmb{e}) = (\pmb{f} -\sum_jc_j\pmb{\varphi}_j,\pmb{f} -\sum_jc_j\pmb{\varphi}_j)
        \nonumber\\
        &= (\pmb{f},\pmb{f}) - 2\sum_{j=0}^Nc_j(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_j) +
        \sum_{p=0}^N\sum_{q=0}^N c_pc_q(\pmb{\varphi}_p,\pmb{\varphi}_q)\thinspace .
        
        

Minimizing this :math:`E` with respect to the independent variables
:math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` is obtained by setting


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial E}{\partial c_i} = 0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N
        \thinspace .
        

The second term in :eq:`fem:vec:genE` is differentiated as follows:


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial}{\partial c_i}
        \sum_{j=0}^Nc_j(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_j) = (\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_i),
        

since the expression to be differentiated is a sum and only one term,
:math:`c_i(\pmb{f},\pmb{\varphi}_i)`,
contains :math:`c_i` and this term is linear in :math:`c_i`.
To understand this differentiation in detail, write out the sum specifically for,
e.g, :math:`N=3` and :math:`i=1`.

The last term in :eq:`fem:vec:genE`
is more tedious to differentiate. We start with


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial}{\partial c_i}
        c_pc_q =
        \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        0, & \hbox{ if } p\neq i\hbox{ and } q\neq i,\\
        c_q, & \hbox{ if } p=i\hbox{ and } q\neq i,\\
        c_p, & \hbox{ if } p\neq i\hbox{ and } q=i,\\
        2c_i, & \hbox{ if } p=q= i,\\
        \end{array}\right.
        

Then


.. math::
         \frac{\partial}{\partial c_i}
        \sum_{p=0}^N\sum_{q=0}^N c_pc_q(\pmb{\varphi}_p,\pmb{\varphi}_q)
        = \sum_{p=0, p\neq i}^N c_p(\pmb{\varphi}_p,\pmb{\varphi}_i)
        + \sum_{q=0, q\neq i}^N c_q(\pmb{\varphi}_q,\pmb{\varphi}_i)
        +2c_i(\pmb{\varphi}_i,\pmb{\varphi}_i)\thinspace . 

The last term can be included in the other two sums, resulting in


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial}{\partial c_i}
        \sum_{p=0}^N\sum_{q=0}^N c_pc_q(\pmb{\varphi}_p,\pmb{\varphi}_q)
        = 2\sum_{j=0}^N c_i(\pmb{\varphi}_j,\pmb{\varphi}_i)\thinspace . 

It then follows that setting


.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial E}{\partial c_i} = 0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N,

leads to a linear system
for :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`:


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:eqsys
        
        \sum_{j=0}^N A_{i,j} c_j = b_i, \quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        
        

where


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} &= (\pmb{\varphi}_i,\pmb{\varphi}_j),\\
        b_i &= (\pmb{\varphi}_i, \pmb{f})\thinspace . 

(Note that we can change the order of the two vectors in the inner
product as desired.)

The Galerkin method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In analogy with the "one-dimensional" example in
the section :ref:`fem:approx:vec:plane`, it holds also here in the general
case that minimizing the distance
(error) :math:`\pmb{e}` is equivalent to demanding that :math:`\pmb{e}` is orthogonal to
all :math:`\pmb{v}\in V`:

.. index:: Galerkin method



.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin
        
        (\pmb{e},\pmb{v})=0,\quad \forall\pmb{v}\in V\thinspace .
        
        

Since any :math:`\pmb{v}\in V` can be written as :math:`\pmb{v} =\sum_{i=0}^N c_i\pmb{\varphi}_i`,
the statement :eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin` is equivalent to
saying that


.. math::
         (\pmb{e}, \sum_{i=0}^N c_i\pmb{\varphi}_i) = 0,

for any choice of coefficients :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N\in\mathbb{R}`.
The latter equation can be rewritten as


.. math::
         \sum_{i=0}^Nc_i (\pmb{e},\pmb{\varphi}_i) =0\thinspace . 

If this is to hold for arbitrary values of :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`,
we must require that each term in the sum vanishes,


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin0
        
        (\pmb{e},\pmb{\varphi}_i)=0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace .
        
        

These :math:`N+1` equations result in the same linear system as
:eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:eqsys`:


.. math::
         (\pmb{f} - \sum_{j=0}^Nc_j\pmb{\varphi}_j, \pmb{\varphi}_i) = (\pmb{f}, \pmb{\varphi}_i) - \sum_{j=0}^N
        (\pmb{\varphi}_i,\pmb{\varphi}_j)c_j = 0,

and hence


.. math::
         \sum_{j=0}^N (\pmb{\varphi}_i,\pmb{\varphi}_j)c_j = (\pmb{f}, \pmb{\varphi}_i),\quad i=0,\ldots, N
        \thinspace .
        

So, instead of differentiating the
:math:`E(c_0,\ldots,c_N)` function, we could simply use
:eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin` as the principle for
determining :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`, resulting in the :math:`N+1`
equations :eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin0`.

The names *least squares method* or *least squares approximation*
are natural since the calculations consists of
minimizing :math:`||\pmb{e}||^2`, and :math:`||\pmb{e}||^2` is a sum of squares
of differences between the components in :math:`\pmb{f}` and :math:`\pmb{u}`.
We find :math:`\pmb{u}` such that this sum of squares is minimized.

The principle :eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin`,
or the equivalent form :eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin0`, has its name
after the its inventor, the Russian mathematician `Boris Galerkin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Galerkin>`_, who
used the approach to solve differential equations.

.. _fem:approx:global:

Approximation of functions
==========================

.. index::
   single: approximation; of functions


Let :math:`V` be a function space spanned by a set of *basis functions*
:math:`\varphi_0,\ldots,\varphi_N`,


.. math::
         V = \hbox{span}\,\{\varphi_0,\ldots,\varphi_N\},

such that any function :math:`u\in V` can be written as a linear
combination of the basis functions:


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:ufem
        
        u = \sum_{j=0}^N c_j\varphi_j\thinspace .
        
        

For now, in this introduction, we shall look at functions of a
single variable :math:`x`:
:math:`u=u(x)`, :math:`\varphi_i=\varphi_i(x)`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`. Later, we will extend
the scope to functions of two- or three-dimensional physical spaces.
The approximation :eq:`fem:approx:ufem` is typically used
to discretize a problem in space. Other methods, most notably
finite differences, are common for time discretization (although the
form :eq:`fem:approx:ufem` can be used in time too).

.. _fem:approx:LS:

The least squares method
------------------------

Given a function :math:`f(x)`, how can we determine its best approximation
:math:`u(x)\in V`? A natural starting point is to apply the same reasoning
as we did for vectors in the section :ref:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim`. That is,
we minimize the distance between :math:`u` and :math:`f`. However, this requires
a norm for measuring distances, and a norm is most conveniently
defined through an
inner product. Viewing a function as a vector of infinitely
many point values, one for each value of :math:`x`, the inner product could
intuitively be defined as the usual summation of
pairwise components, with summation replaced by integration:


.. math::
        
        (f,g) = \int f(x)g(x)\, dx
        \thinspace .
        

To fix the integration domain, we let :math:`f(x)` and :math:`\varphi_i(x)`
be defined for a domain :math:`\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}`.
The inner product of two functions :math:`f(x)` and :math:`g(x)` is then


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:LS:innerprod
        
        (f,g) = \int_\Omega f(x)g(x)\, dx
        
        \thinspace .
        


The distance between :math:`f` and any function :math:`u\in V` is simply
:math:`f-u`, and the squared norm of this distance is


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:LS:E
        
        E = (f(x)-\sum_{j=0}^Nc_j\varphi_j(x), f(x)-\sum_{j=0}^Nc_j\varphi_j(x))\thinspace .
        
        

Note the analogy with :eq:`fem:vec:genE`: the given function
:math:`f` plays the role of the given vector :math:`\pmb{f}`, and the basis function
:math:`\varphi_i` plays the role of the basis vector :math:`\pmb{\varphi}_i`.
We get can rewrite :eq:`fem:approx:LS:E`,
through similar steps as used for the result
:eq:`fem:vec:genE`, leading to


.. math::
        
        E(c_0,\ldots,c_N) = (f,f) -2\sum_{j=0}^N c_j(f,\varphi_i)
        + \sum_{p=0}^N\sum_{q=0}^N c_pc_q(\varphi_p,\varphi_q)\thinspace . 

Minimizing this function of :math:`N+1` scalar variables
:math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` requires differentiation
with respect to :math:`c_i`, for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`. The resulting
equations are very similar to those we had in the vector case,
and we hence end up with a
linear system of the form :eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:eqsys`, with


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} &= (\varphi_i,\varphi_j),
        \\
        b_i &= (f,\varphi_i)\thinspace .
        
        


The Galerkin method
-------------------


.. index:: Galerkin method


As in the section :ref:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim`, the minimization of :math:`(e,e)`
is equivalent to


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:Galerkin
        
        (e,v)=0,\quad\forall v\in V\thinspace .
        
        

This is known as the Galerkin method for approximating functions.
Using the same reasoning as
in
:eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin`-:eq:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin0`,
it follows that :eq:`fem:approx:Galerkin` is equivalent to


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:Galerkin0
        
        (e,\varphi_i)=0,\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace .
        
        

Inserting :math:`e=f-u` in this equation and ordering terms, as in the
multi-dimensional vector case, we end up with a linear
system with a coefficient matrix (:ref:`fem:approx:Aij`) and
right-hand side vector (:ref:`fem:approx:bi`).

Whether we work with vectors in the plane, general vectors, or
functions in function spaces, the least squares principle and
the Galerkin method are equivalent.

.. _fem:approx:global:linear:

Example: linear approximation
-----------------------------

Let us apply the theory in the previous section to a simple problem:
given a parabola :math:`f(x)=x^2+x+1` for :math:`x\in\Omega=[1,2]`, find
the best approximation :math:`u(x)` in the space of all linear functions:


.. math::
         V = \hbox{span}\,\{1, x\}\thinspace . 

That is, :math:`\varphi_0(x)=1`, :math:`\varphi_1(x)=x`, and :math:`N=1`.
We seek


.. math::
         u=c_0\varphi_0(x) + c_1\varphi_1(x) = c_0 + c_1x,

where
:math:`c_0` and :math:`c_1` are found by solving a :math:`2\times 2` the linear system.
The coefficient matrix has elements


.. math::
        
        A_{0,0} &= (\varphi_0,\varphi_0) = \int_1^21\cdot 1\, dx = 1,\\
        A_{0,1} &= (\varphi_0,\varphi_1) = \int_1^2 1\cdot x\, dx = 3/2,\\
        A_{1,0} &= A_{0,1} = 3/2,\\
        A_{1,1} &= (\varphi_1,\varphi_1) = \int_1^2 x\cdot x\,dx = 7/3\thinspace . 

The corresponding right-hand side is


.. math::
        
        b_1 &= (f,\varphi_0) = \int_1^2 (10(x-1)^2 - 1)\cdot 1 \, dx = 7/3,\\
        b_2 &= (f,\varphi_1) = \int_1^2 (10(x-1)^2 - 1)\cdot x\, dx = 13/3\thinspace . 

Solving the linear system results in


.. math::
        
        c_0 = -38/3,\quad c_1 = 10,
        

and consequently


.. math::
        
        u(x) = 10x - \frac{38}{3}\thinspace . 

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:linear` displays the
parabola and its best approximation in the space of all linear functions.

.. _fem:approx:global:LS:code:

Implementation of the least squares method
------------------------------------------

The linear system can be computed either symbolically or
numerically (a numerical integration rule is needed in the latter case).
Here is a function for symbolic computation of the linear system,
where :math:`f(x)` is given as a ``sympy`` expression ``f`` (involving
the symbol ``x``), ``phi`` is a list of :math:`\varphi_0,\ldots,\varphi_N`,
and ``Omega`` is a 2-tuple/list holding the domain :math:`\Omega`:


.. code-block:: python

        import sympy as sm
        
        def least_squares(f, phi, Omega):
            N = len(phi) - 1
            A = sm.zeros((N+1, N+1))
            b = sm.zeros((N+1, 1))
            x = sm.Symbol('x')
            for i in range(N+1):
                for j in range(i, N+1):
                    A[i,j] = sm.integrate(phi[i]*phi[j],
                                          (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                    A[j,i] = A[i,j]
                b[i,0] = sm.integrate(phi[i]*f, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
            c = A.LUsolve(b)
            u = 0
            for i in range(len(phi)):
                u += c[i,0]*phi[i]
            return u

Observe that we exploit the symmetry of the coefficient matrix:
only the upper triangular part is computed. Symbolic integration in
``sympy`` is often time consuming, and (roughly) halving the
work has noticeable effect on the waiting time for the function to
finish execution.

Comparing the given :math:`f(x)` and the approximate :math:`u(x)` visually is
done by the following function, which with the aid of
`sympy`'s ``lambdify`` tool converts a ``sympy``
functional expression to a Python function for numerical
computations:


.. code-block:: python

        def comparison_plot(f, u, Omega, filename='tmp.pdf'):
            x = sm.Symbol('x')
            f = sm.lambdify([x], f, modules="numpy")
            u = sm.lambdify([x], u, modules="numpy")
            resolution = 401  # no of points in plot
            xcoor  = linspace(Omega[0], Omega[1], resolution)
            exact  = f(xcoor)
            approx = u(xcoor)
            plot(xcoor, approx)
            hold('on')
            plot(xcoor, exact)
            legend(['approximation', 'exact'])
            savefig(filename)

The ``modules='numpy'`` argument to ``lambdify`` is important
if there are mathematical functions, such as ``sin`` or ``exp``
in the symbolic expressions in ``f`` or ``u``, and these
mathematical functions are to be used with vector arguments, like
``xcoor`` above.

Both the ``least_squares`` and
``comparison_plot``
are found and coded in the file
`approx1D.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/fem/fe_approx1D.py>`_.
The forthcoming examples on their use appear in
``ex_approx1D.py``.


.. _fem:approx:global:exact:

Perfect approximation
---------------------

Let us use the code above to recompute the problem from
the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:linear` where we want to approximate
a parabola. What happens if we add an element :math:`x^2` to the basis and test what
the best approximation is if :math:`V` is the space of all parabolic functions?
The answer is quickly found by running


.. code-block:: python

        >>> from approx1D import *
        >>> x = sm.Symbol('x')
        >>> f = 10*(x-1)**2-1
        >>> u = least_squares(f=f, phi=[1, x, x**2], Omega=[1, 2])
        >>> print u
        10*x**2 - 20*x + 9
        >>> print sm.expand(f)
        10*x**2 - 20*x + 9


Now, what if we use :math:`\phi_i(x)=x^i` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N=40`?
The output from ``least_squares`` gives :math:`c_i=0` for :math:`i>2`.
In fact, we have a general result that
if :math:`f\in V`, the least squares and Galerkin methods compute
the exact solution :math:`u=f`.

The proof is straightforward: if :math:`f\in V`, :math:`f` can be expanded in
terms of the basis functions, :math:`f=\sum_{j=0}^Nd_j\varphi_j`, for
some coefficients :math:`d_0,\ldots,d_N`,
and the right-hand side then has entries


.. math::
         b_i = (f,\varphi_i) = \sum_{j=0}^Nd_j(\varphi_j, \varphi_i) = \sum_{j=0}^Nd_jA_{i,j}
        \thinspace . 

The linear system :math:`\sum_jA_{i,j}c_j = b_i`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`, is then


.. math::
         \sum_{j=0}^Nc_jA_{i,j} = \sum_{j=0}^Nd_jA_{i,j},\quad i=0,\ldots,N,

which implies that :math:`c_i=d_i` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`.

.. _fem:approx:global:illconditioning:

Ill-conditioning
----------------

The computational example in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:exact`
applies the ``least_squares`` function which invokes symbolic
methods to calculate and solve the linear system. The correct
solution :math:`c_0=9, c_1=-20, c_2=10, c_i=0` for :math:`i\geq 3` is perfectly
recovered.

Suppose we
convert the matrix and right-hand side to floating-point arrays
and then solve the system using finite-precision arithmetics, which
is what one will (almost) always do in real life. This time we
get astonishing results! Up to about :math:`N=7` we get a solution that
is reasonably close to the exact one. Increasing :math:`N` shows that
seriously wrong coefficients are computed.
Below is a table showing the solution of the linear system arising from
approximating a parabola
by functions on the form :math:`u(x)=\sum_{j=0}^Nc_jx^j`, :math:`N=10`.
Analytically, we know that :math:`c_j=0` for :math:`j>2`, but ill-conditioning
may produce :math:`c_j\neq 0` for :math:`j>2`.

The exact value of :math:`c_j`, :math:`j=0,\ldots,10`, appears in the first
column while the other columns correspond to results obtained
by three different methods:

  * Column 2: The matrix and vector are converted to
    the data structure  ``sympy.mpmath.fp.matrix`` and the
    ``sympy.mpmath.fp.lu_solve`` function is used to solve the system.

  * Column 3: The matrix and vector are converted to
    ``numpy`` arrays with data type ``numpy.float32``
    (single precision floating-point number) and solved by
    the ``numpy.linalg.solve`` function.

  * Column 4: As column 3, but the data type is
    ``numpy.float64`` (double
    precision floating-point number).

We see from the numbers in the table that
double precision performs much better than single precision.
Nevertheless, when plotting all these solutions the curves cannot be
visually distinguished (!). This means that the approximations look
perfect, despite the partially wrong values of the coefficients.

Increasing :math:`N` to 12 makes the numerical solver in ``sympy`` report
abort with the message: "matrix is numerically singular".
A matrix has to be non-singular to be invertible, which is a requirement
when solving a linear system. Already when the matrix is close to
singular, it is *ill-conditioned*, which here implies that
the numerical solution algorithms are sensitive to round-off
errors and may produce (very) inaccurate results.

The reason why the coefficient matrix is nearly singular and
ill-conditioned is that our basis functions :math:`\varphi_i(x)=x^i` are
nearly linearly dependent for large :math:`i`.  That is, :math:`x^i` and :math:`x^{i+1}`
are very close for :math:`i` not very small. This phenomenon is
illustrated in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:illconditioning`.
There are 15 lines in this figure, but only half of them are
visually distinguishable.
Almost linearly dependent basis functions give rise to an
ill-conditioned and almost singular matrix.  This fact can be
illustrated by computing the determinant, which is indeed very close
to zero (recall that a zero determinant implies a singular and
non-invertible matrix): :math:`10^{-65}` for :math:`N=10` and :math:`10^{-92}` for
:math:`N=12`. Already for :math:`N=28` the numerical determinant computation
returns a plain zero.

.. figure:: fig-fem/ill_conditioning.png
   :width: 600

   The 15 first basis functions :math:`x^i`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,14`


On the other hand, the double precision ``numpy`` solver do run for
:math:`N=100`, resulting in answers that are not significantly worse than
those in the table above, and large powers are
associated with small coefficients (e.g., :math:`c_j<10^{-2}` for :math:`10\leq
j\leq 20` and :math:`c<10^{-5}` for :math:`j>20`). Even for :math:`N=100` the
approximation lies on top of the exact curve in a plot (!).

The conclusion is that visual inspection of the quality of the approximation
may not uncover fundamental numerical problems with the computations.
However, numerical analysts have studied approximations and ill-conditioning
for decades, and it is well known that the basis :math:`\{1,x,x^2,x^3,\ldots,\}`
is a bad basis. The best basis from a matrix conditioning point of view
is to have orthogonal functions such that :math:`(\phi_i,\phi_j)=0` for
:math:`i\neq j`. There are many known sets of orthogonal polynomials.
The functions used in the finite element methods are almost orthogonal,
and this property helps to avoid problems with solving matrix systems.
Almost orthogonal is helpful, but not enough when it comes to
partial differential equations, and ill-conditioning
of the coefficient matrix is a theme when solving large-scale finite
element systems.

.. _fem:approx:global:Fourier:

Fourier series
--------------

.. index::
   single: approximation; by sines


A set of sine functions is widely used for approximating functions.
Let us take


.. math::
        
        V = \hbox{span}\,\{ \sin \pi x, \sin 2\pi x,\ldots,\sin (N+1)\pi x\}
        \thinspace . 

That is,


.. math::
         \varphi_i(x) = \sin ((i+1)\pi x),\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace . 

An approximation to the :math:`f(x)` function from
the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:linear` can then be computed by the
``least_squares`` function from the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:LS:code`:


.. code-block:: python

        N = 3
        from sympy import sin, pi
        phi = [sin(pi*(i+1)*x) for i in range(N+1)]
        f = 10*(x-1)**2 - 1
        Omega = [0, 1]
        u = least_squares(f, phi, Omega)
        comparison_plot(f, u, Omega)

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine1` (left) shows the oscillatory approximation
of :math:`\sum_{j=0}^{N}c_j\sin ((j+1)\pi x)` when :math:`N=3`.
Changing :math:`N` to 11 improves the approximation considerably, see
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine1` (right).


.. _fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine1:

   *Best approximation of a parabola by a sum of 3 (left) and 11 (right) sine functions*


There is an error :math:`f(0)-u(0)=9` at :math:`x=0` in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine1` regardless of how large :math:`N` is, because all :math:`\varphi_i(0)=0` and hence
:math:`u(0)=0`. We may help the approximation to be correct at :math:`x=0` by
seeking


.. math::
        
        u(x) = f(0) + \sum_{j=0}^N c_j\varphi_j(x)
        \thinspace .
        

However, this adjustments introduces a new problem at :math:`x=1` since
we now get an error :math:`f(1)-u(1)=f(1)-0=-1` at this point. A more
clever adjustment is to replace the :math:`f(0)` term by a term that
is :math:`f(0)` at :math:`x=0` and :math:`f(1)` at :math:`x=1`. A simple linear combination
:math:`f(0)(1-x) + xf(1)` does the job:

.. math::
        
        u(x) = f(0)(1-x) + xf(1) + \sum_{j=0}^N c_j\varphi_j(x)
        \thinspace .
        

This adjustment of :math:`u` alters the linear system slightly as we get an extra
term :math:`-(f(0)(1-x) + xf(1),\varphi_i)` on the right-hand side.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine2` shows the result
of ensuring right boundary values: even 3 sines can now adjust the
:math:`f(0)(1-x) + xf(1)` term such that :math:`u` approximates the parabola really
well, at least visually.

.. _fem:approx:global:orth:

Orthogonal basis functions
--------------------------

The choice of sine functions :math:`\varphi_i(x)=\sin ((i+1)\pi x)` has a great
computational advantage: on :math:`\Omega=[0,1]` these basis functions are
*orthogonal*, implying that :math:`A_{i,j}=0` if :math:`i\neq j`. This
result is realized by trying


.. code-block:: python

        integrate(sin(j*pi*x)*sin(k*pi*x), x, 0, 1)

in `WolframAlpha <http://wolframalpha.com>`_
(avoid ``i`` in the integrand as this symbol means
the imaginary unit :math:`\sqrt{-1}`).
Also by asking WolframAlpha
about :math:`\int_0^1\sin^2 (j\pi x) dx`, we find it
to equal 1/2.
With a diagonal matrix we can easily solve for the coefficients
by hand:


.. math::
        
        c_i = 2\int_0^1 f(x)\sin ((i+1)\pi x) dx,\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        

which is nothing but the classical formula for the coefficients of
the Fourier sine series of :math:`f(x)` on :math:`[0,1]`. In fact, when
:math:`V` contains the basic functions used in a Fourier series expansion,
the approximation method derived in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global`
results in the classical Fourier series for :math:`f(x)` (see :ref:`fem:approx:exer:Fourier`
for details).

For orthogonal basis functions we can make the
``least_squares`` function (much) more efficient since we know that
the matrix is diagonal and only the diagonal elements need to be computed:


.. code-block:: python

        def least_squares_orth(f, phi, Omega):
            N = len(phi) - 1
            A = [0]*(N+1)
            b = [0]*(N+1)
            x = sm.Symbol('x')
            for i in range(N+1):
                A[i] = sm.integrate(phi[i]**2, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                b[i] = sm.integrate(phi[i]*f,  (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
            c = [b[i]/A[i] for i in range(len(b))]
            u = 0
            for i in range(len(phi)):
                u += c[i]*phi[i]
            return u

This function is found in the file ``approx1D.py``.

.. _fem:approx:global:interp:

The collocation or interpolation method
---------------------------------------


.. index:: collocation method (approximation)


.. index::
   single: approximation; collocation


The principle of minimizing the distance between :math:`u` and :math:`f` is
an intuitive way of computing a best approximation :math:`u\in V` to :math:`f`.
However, there are other attractive approaches as well.
One is to demand that :math:`u(x_{i}) = f(x_{i})` at some selected points
:math:`x_{i}`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`:


.. math::
        
        u(x_{i}) = \sum_{j=0}^N c_j \varphi_j(x_{i}) = f(x_{i}),\quad i=0,\ldots,N\thinspace . 

This criterion also gives a linear system
with :math:`N+1` unknown coefficients :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`:


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^N A_{i,j}c_j = b_i,\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        

with


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} &= \varphi_j(x_{i}),\\
        b_i &= f(x_{i})\thinspace . 

This time the coefficient matrix is not symmetric because
:math:`\varphi_j(x_{i})\neq \varphi_i(x_{j})` in general.
The method is often referred to as a *collocation method*
and the :math:`x_{i}` points are known as *collocation points*.
Others view the approach as an *interpolation method*
since some point values of :math:`f` are given (:math:`f(x_{i})`) and we
fit a continuous function :math:`u` that goes through the :math:`f(x_{i})` points.
In that case the :math:`x_{i}` points are called *interpolation points*.

``points``, the following Python function sets up and solves the matrix system
for the coefficients :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N`:

            c = A.LUsolve(b)
            u = 0
            for i in range(len(phi)):
                u += c[i,0]*phi[i](x)
            return u

Note that it is convenient to turn the expressions ``f`` and
``phi`` into Python functions which can be called with
elements of ``points`` as arguments when building the matrix and
the right-hand side.
The ``interpolation`` function is a part of the ``approx1D``
module.

A nice feature of the interpolation or collocation method is that it
avoids computing integrals. However, one has to decide on the location
of the :math:`x_{i}` points.  A simple, yet common choice, is to
distribute them uniformly throughout :math:`\Omega`.

Example
~~~~~~~

Let us illustrate the interpolation or collocation method by approximating
our parabola :math:`f(x)=10(x-1)^2-1` by a linear function on :math:`\Omega=[1,2]`,
using two collocation points :math:`x_0=1+1/3` and :math:`x_1=1+2/3`:


.. code-block:: python

        f = 10*(x-1)**2 - 1
        phi = [1, x]
        Omega = [1, 2]
        points = [1 + sm.Rational(1,3), 1 + sm.Rational(2,3)]
        u = interpolation(f, phi, points)
        comparison_plot(f, u, Omega)

The resulting linear system becomes


.. math::
        
        \left(\begin{array}{ll}
        1 & 4/3\\
        1 & 5/3\\
        \end{array}\right)
        \left(\begin{array}{l}
        c_0\\
        c_1\\
        \end{array}\right)
        =
        \left(\begin{array}{l}
        1/9\\
        31/9\\
        \end{array}\right)
        

with solution :math:`c_0=-119/9` and :math:`c_1=10`.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:linear:interp:fig1` (left) shows the resulting
approximation :math:`u=-119/9 + 10x`.
We can easily test other interpolation points, say :math:`x_0=1` and :math:`x_1=2`.
This changes the line quite significantly, see
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:linear:interp:fig1` (right).

Lagrange polynomials
--------------------

.. index:: Lagrange (interpolating) polynomial


In the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:Fourier` we explain the advantage with having
a diagonal matrix: formulas for the coefficients :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` can
then be derived by hand. For a interpolation or collocation method a
diagonal matrix implies that
:math:`\varphi_j(x_{i}) = 0` if :math:`i\neq j`. One set of basis functions :math:`\varphi_i(x)`
with this property is the *Lagrange interpolating polynomials*,
or just *Lagrange polynomials*. (Although the functions are named
after Lagrange, they were first discovered by Waring in 1779,
rediscovered by Euler in 1783, and published by Lagrange in 1795.)
The Lagrange polynomials have the form


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:global:Lagrange:poly
        
        \varphi_i(x) =
        \prod_{j=0,j\neq i}^N
        \frac{x-x_{j}}{x_{i}-x_{j}}
        = \frac{x-x_0}{x_{i}-x_0}\cdots\frac{x-x_{i-1}}{x_{i}-x_{i-1}}\frac{x-x_{i+1}}{x_{i}-x_{i+1}}
        \cdots\frac{x-x_N}{x_{i}-x_N},
        
        

for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`.
We see from :eq:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:poly` that all the :math:`\varphi_i`
functions are polynomials of degree :math:`N` which have the property


.. math::
   :label: fem:inter:prop
        
        \varphi_i(x_s) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        1, & i=s,\\
        0, & i\neq s,
        \end{array}\right.
        
        

when :math:`x_s` is an interpolation (collocation) point.
This property implies that :math:`A_{i,j}=0` for :math:`i\neq j` and
:math:`A_{i,j}=1` when :math:`i=j`. The solution of the linear system is
them simply


.. math::
        
        c_i = f(x_{i}),\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        

and


.. math::
        
        u(x) = \sum_{j=0}^N f(x_{i})\varphi_i(x)\thinspace . 


The following function computes the Lagrange interpolating polynomial
:math:`\varphi_i(x)`, given the interpolation points :math:`x_{0},\ldots,x_{N}` in
the list or array ``points``:


.. code-block:: python

        def Lagrange_polynomial(x, i, points):
            p = 1
            for k in range(len(points)):
                if k != i:
                    p *= (x - points[k])/(points[i] - points[k])
            return p

The next function computes a complete basis using equidistant points throughout
:math:`\Omega`:


.. code-block:: python

        def Lagrange_polynomials_01(x, N):
            if isinstance(x, sm.Symbol):
                h = sm.Rational(1, N-1)
            else:
                h = 1.0/(N-1)
            points = [i*h for i in range(N)]
            phi = [Lagrange_polynomial(x, i, points) for i in range(N)]
            return phi, points

When ``x`` is an ``sm.Symbol`` object, we let the
spacing between
the interpolation points, ``h``, be a ``sympy`` rational number
for nice end results in the formulas for :math:`\varphi_i`.
The other case, when ``x`` is a plain Python ``float``,
signifies numerical computing, and then we let ``h`` be a floating-point
number.
Observe that the ``Lagrange_polynomial`` function works equally well
in the symbolic and numerical case (think of ``x`` being an
``sm.Symbol`` object or a Python ``float``).
A little interactive session illustrates the difference between symbolic
and numerical computing of the basis functions and points:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> import sympy as sm
        >>> x = sm.Symbol('x')
        >>> phi, points = Lagrange_polynomials_01(x, N=3)
        >>> points
        [0, 1/2, 1]
        >>> phi
        [(1 - x)*(1 - 2*x), 2*x*(2 - 2*x), -x*(1 - 2*x)]
        
        >>> x = 0.5  # numerical computing
        >>> phi, points = Lagrange_polynomials_01(x, N=3, symbolic=True)
        >>> points
        [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
        >>> phi
        [-0.0, 1.0, 0.0]

The Lagrange polynomials are very much used in finite element methods
because of their property :eq:`fem:inter:prop`.

Successful example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trying out the Lagrange polynomial basis for approximating
:math:`f(x)=\sin 2\pi x` on :math:`\Omega =[0,1]` with the least squares
and the interpolation techniques can be done by


.. code-block:: python

        x = sm.Symbol('x')
        f = sm.sin(2*sm.pi*x)
        phi, points = Lagrange_polynomials_01(x, N)
        Omega=[0, 1]
        u = least_squares(f, phi, Omega)
        comparison_plot(f, u, Omega)
        u = interpolation(f, phi, points)
        comparison_plot(f, u, Omega)

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:sine:ls:colloc` shows the results.
There is little difference between the least squares and the interpolation
technique. Increasing :math:`N` gives visually better approximations.

   *Approximation via least squares (left) and interpolation (right) of a sine function by Lagrange interpolating polynomials of degree 4*


Less successful example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next example concerns interpolating :math:`f(x)=|1-2x|` on
:math:`\Omega =[0,1]` using Lagrange polynomials. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:unif:7:14` shows a peculiar effect: the approximation starts to oscillate
more and more as :math:`N` grows. This numerical artifact is not surprising
when looking at the individual Lagrange polynomials: Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:unif:osc` shows two such polynomials of degree 11, and it is clear
that the basis functions oscillate significantly. The reason is simple,
since we force the functions to be 1 at one point and 0 at many other
points. A polynomial of high degree is then forced to oscillate between
these points. The oscillations are particularly severe at the boundary.
The phenomenon is named *Runge's phenomenon* and you can read

.. index:: Runge's phenomenon

a more detailed explanation on Wikipedia.


.. index:: Chebyshev nodes


Remedy for strong oscillations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The oscillations can be reduced by a more clever choice of
interpolation points, called the *Chebyshev nodes*:


.. math::
        
        x_{i} = \frac{1}{2} (a+b) + \frac{1}{2}(b-a)\cos\left( \frac{2i+1}{2(N+1)}pi\right),\quad i=0\ldots,N,
        

on the interval :math:`\Omega = [a,b]`.
Here is a flexible version of the ``Lagrange_polynomials_01`` function above,
valid for any interval :math:`\Omega =[a,b]` and with the possibility to generate
both uniformly distributed points and Chebyshev nodes:


.. code-block:: python

        def Lagrange_polynomials(x, N, Omega, point_distribution='uniform'):
            if point_distribution == 'uniform':
                if isinstance(x, sm.Symbol):
                    h = sm.Rational(Omega[1] - Omega[0], N)
                else:
                    h = (Omega[1] - Omega[0])/float(N)
                points = [Omega[0] + i*h for i in range(N+1)]
            elif point_distribution == 'Chebyshev':
                points = Chebyshev_nodes(Omega[0], Omega[1], N)
            phi = [Lagrange_polynomial(x, i, points) for i in range(N+1)]
            return phi, points
        
        def Chebyshev_nodes(a, b, N):
            from math import cos, pi
            return [0.5*(a+b) + 0.5*(b-a)*cos(float(2*i+1)/(2*(N+1))*pi) \
                    for i in range(N+1)]

All the functions computing Lagrange polynomials listed
above are found in the module file ``Lagrange.py``.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:Cheb:7:14` shows the improvement of
using Chebyshev nodes (compared with Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:unif:7:14`).

Another cure for undesired oscillation of higher-degree interpolating
polynomials is to use lower-degree Lagrange
polynomials on many small patches of the domain, which is the idea
pursued in the finite element method. For instance, linear Lagrange
polynomials on :math:`[0,1/2]` and :math:`[1/2,1]` would yield a perfect
approximation to :math:`f(x)=|1-2x|` on :math:`\Omega = [0,1]`
since :math:`f` is piecewise linear.

Unfortunately, ``sympy`` has problems integrating the :math:`f(x)=|1-2x|`
function times a polynomial. Other choices of :math:`f(x)` can also
make the symbolic integration fail. Therefore, we should extend
the ``least_squares`` function such that it falls back on
numerical integration if the symbolic integration is unsuccessful.
In the latter case, the returned value from `sympy`'s
``integrate`` function is an object of type ``Integral``.
We can test on this type and utilize the ``mpmath`` module in
``sympy`` to perform numerical integration of high precision.
Here is the code:


.. code-block:: python

        def least_squares(f, phi, Omega):
            N = len(phi) - 1
            A = sm.zeros((N+1, N+1))
            b = sm.zeros((N+1, 1))
            x = sm.Symbol('x')
            for i in range(N+1):
                for j in range(i, N+1):
                    integrand = phi[i]*phi[j]
                    I = sm.integrate(integrand, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                    if isinstance(I, sm.Integral):
                        # Could not integrate symbolically, fallback
                        # on numerical integration with mpmath.quad
                        integrand = sm.lambdify([x], integrand)
                        I = sm.mpmath.quad(integrand, [Omega[0], Omega[1]])
                    A[i,j] = A[j,i] = I
                integrand = phi[i]*f
                I = sm.integrate(integrand, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                if isinstance(I, sm.Integral):
                    integrand = sm.lambdify([x], integrand)
                    I = sm.mpmath.quad(integrand, [Omega[0], Omega[1]])
                b[i,0] = I
            c = A.LUsolve(b)
            u = 0
            for i in range(len(phi)):
                u += c[i,0]*phi[i]
            return u

Finite element basis functions
==============================

The specific basis functions exemplified in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global` are in general nonzero on the entire domain
:math:`\Omega`, see Figure{fem:approx:fe:fig:u:sin} for an example. We shall
now turn the attention to basis functions that have *compact support*,
meaning that they are nonzero on only a small portion of
:math:`\Omega`. Moreover, we shall restrict the functions to be *piecewise
polynomials*. This means that the domain is split into subdomains and
the function is a polynomial on one or more subdomains, see Figure
:ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:u:sfe` for a sketch involving locally defined
hat functions that make :math:`u=\sum_jc_j\varphi_j` piecewise linear. At
the boundaries between subdomains one normally forces continuity of
the function only so that when connecting two polynomials from two
subdomains, the derivative usually becomes discontinuous. These type
of basis functions are fundamental in the *finite element method*.

.. _fem:approx:fe:fig:u:fe:

.. figure:: fig-fem/u_example_fe.png
   :width: 600

   *Approximation based on local piecewise linear (hat) functions*


We first introduce the concepts of elements and nodes in a simplistic fashion
as often met in the literature. Later, we shall generalize the concept
of an element, which is a necessary step to treat a wider class of
approximations within the family of finite element methods.
The generalization is also compatible with
the concepts used in the `FEniCS <http://fenicsproject.org>`_ finite
element software.

.. _fem:approx:fe:def:elements:nodes:

Elements and nodes
------------------

Let us divide the interval :math:`\Omega` on which :math:`f` and :math:`u` are defined
into non-overlapping subintervals :math:`\Omega^{(e)}`, :math:`e=0,\ldots,n_e`:


.. math::
        
        \Omega = \Omega^{(0)}\cup \cdots \cup \Omega^{(n_e)}\thinspace . 

We shall for now
refer to :math:`\Omega^{(e)}` as an *element*, having number :math:`e`.
On each element we introduce a set of points called *nodes*.
For now we assume that the nodes are uniformly spaced throughout the
element and that the boundary points of the elements are also nodes.
The nodes are given numbers both within an element and in the global
domain. These are
referred to as *local* and *global* node numbers, respectively.

Nodes and elements uniquely define a *finite element mesh*, which is our
discrete representation of the domain in the computations.
.. index:: finite element mesh

.. index::
   single: mesh; finite elements

A common special case is that of a *uniformly partitioned mesh* where
each element has the same length and the distance between nodes is constant.

Example
~~~~~~~

On :math:`\Omega =[0,1]` we may introduce two elements,
:math:`\Omega^{(0)}=[0,0.4]` and :math:`\Omega^{(1)}=[0.4,1]`. Furthermore,
let us introduce three nodes
per element, equally spaced within each element.
The three nodes in element number 0 are :math:`x_0=0`, :math:`x_1=0.2`, and :math:`x_2=0.4`.
The local and global node numbers are here equal.
In element number 1, we have the local nodes :math:`x_0=0.4`, :math:`x_1=0.7`, and :math:`x_2=1`
and the corresponding
global nodes :math:`x_2=0.4`, :math:`x_3=0.7`, and :math:`x_4=1`. Note that
the global node :math:`x_2=0.4` is shared by the two elements.

For the purpose of implementation, we introduce two lists or arrays:
``nodes`` for storing the coordinates of the nodes, with the
global node numbers as indices, and ``elements`` for holding
the global node numbers in each element, with the local node numbers
as indices. The ``nodes`` and ``elements`` lists for the sample mesh
above take the form


.. code-block:: python

        nodes = [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7, 1]
        elements = [[0, 1, 2], [2, 3, 4]]

Looking up the coordinate of local node number 2 in element 1
is here done by ``nodes[elements[1][2]]`` (recall that nodes and
elements start their numbering at 0).

The basis functions
-------------------

Construction principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Standard finite element basis functions are now defined as follows.
Let :math:`i` be the global node number corresponding to local node :math:`r`
in element number :math:`e`.

  * If local node number :math:`r` is not on the boundary of the element,
    take :math:`\varphi_i(x)` to be the Lagrange
    polynomial that is 1 at the local node number :math:`r` and zero
    at all other nodes in the element. On all other elements, :math:`\varphi_i=0`.

  * If local node number :math:`r` is on the boundary of the element,
    let :math:`\varphi_i` be made up of the Lagrange polynomial that is 1 at this node
    in element number :math:`e` and its neighboring element.
    On all other elements, :math:`\varphi_i=0`.

A visual impression of three such basis functions are given in
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2`.
Sometimes we refer to a Lagrange polynomial on an element :math:`e`, which
means the basis function :math:`\varphi_i(x)` when :math:`x\in\Omega^{(e)}`, and
:math:`\varphi_i(x)=0` when :math:`x\notin\Omega^{(e)}`.

.. figure:: fig-fem/phi/mpl_fe_basis_p2_4e_lab.png
   :width: 600

   *Illustration of the piecewise quadratic basis functions associated with nodes in element 1*


Properties of :math:`\varphi_i`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The construction of basis functions according to the principles above
lead to two important properties of :math:`\varphi_i(x)`. First,


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:phi:prop1
        
        \varphi_i(x_{j}) =
        \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        1, & i=j,\\
        0, & i\neq j,
        \end{array}\right.
        
        

when :math:`x_{j}` is a node in the mesh with global node number :math:`j`,
because the Lagrange polynomials are constructed to have this property.
The property also implies a convenient interpretation of :math:`c_i`
as the value of :math:`u` at node :math:`i`:


.. math::
        
        u(x_{i}) = \sum_{j=0}^N c_j \varphi_j (x_{i}) =
        c_i \varphi_i (x_{i}) = c_i
        \thinspace .
        

Because of this interpretation,
the coefficient :math:`c_i` is by many named :math:`u_i` or :math:`U_i`.

.. 2DO: switch to U_j?


Second,
:math:`\varphi_i(x)` is mostly zero throughout the domain:

 * :math:`\varphi_i(x) \neq 0` only on those elements that contain global node :math:`i`,

 * :math:`\varphi_i(x)\varphi_j(x) \neq 0` if and only if :math:`i` and :math:`j` are global node
   numbers in the same element.

Since :math:`A_{i,j}` is the integral of
:math:`\varphi_i\varphi_j` it means that
*most of the elements in the coefficient matrix will be zero*.
We will come back to these properties and use
them actively in computations to save memory and CPU time.

We let each element have :math:`d+1` nodes, resulting in local Lagrange
polynomials of degree :math:`d`. It is not a requirement to have the same
:math:`d` value in each element, but for now we will assume so.

Example on quadratic :math:`\varphi_i`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2` illustrates how piecewise
quadratic basis functions can look like (:math:`d=2`). We work with the
domain :math:`\Omega = [0,1]` divided into four equal-sized elements, each having
three nodes.
The ``nodes`` and ``elements`` lists in this particular example become


.. code-block:: python

        nodes = [0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, 0.875, 1.0]
        elements = [[0, 1, 2], [2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6], [6, 7, 8]]

Nodes are marked with circles on the :math:`x` axis in the figure, and
element boundaries are marked with vertical dashed lines.


.. _fem:approx:fe:fig:P2:

.. figure:: fig-fem/phi/mpl_fe_basis_p2_4e_lab.png
   :width: 600

   *Illustration of the piecewise quadratic basis functions associated with nodes in element 1*


Let us explain in detail how the basis functions are constructed
according to the principles.
Consider element number 1 in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2`,
:math:`\Omega^{(1)}=[0.25, 0.5]`, with local nodes
0, 1, and 2 corresponding to global nodes 2, 3, and 4.
The coordinates of these nodes are
:math:`0.25`, :math:`0.375`, and :math:`0.5`, respectively.
We define three Lagrange
polynomials on this element:

1. The polynomial that is 1 at local node 1
   (:math:`x=0.375`, global node 3) makes up the basis function
   :math:`\varphi_3(x)` over this element,
   with :math:`\varphi_3(x)=0` outside the element.

2. The Lagrange polynomial that is 1 at local node 0 is the "right
   part" of the global basis function
   :math:`\varphi_2(x)`. The "left part" of :math:`\varphi_2(x)` consists of
   a Lagrange polynomial associated with local node 2 in
   the neighboring element :math:`\Omega^{(0)}=[0, 0.25]`.

3. Finally, the polynomial that is 1 at local node 2 (global node 4)
   is the "left part" of the global basis function :math:`\varphi_4(x)`.
   The "right part" comes from the Lagrange polynomial that is 1 at
   local node 0 in the neighboring element :math:`\Omega^{(2)}=[0.5, 0.75]`.

As mentioned earlier,
any global basis function :math:`\varphi_i(x)` is zero on elements that
do not share the node with global node number :math:`i`.

The other global functions associated with internal
nodes, :math:`\varphi_1`, :math:`\varphi_5`, and :math:`\varphi_7`, are all of the
same shape as the drawn :math:`\varphi_3`, while the global basis functions
associated with shared nodes also have the same shape, provided the
elements are of the same length.

.. This was difficult to follow:

.. The basis function :math:`\varphi_2(x)`, corresponding to a node on the

.. boundary of element 0 and 1, is made up of two pieces: (i) the Lagrange

.. polynomial on element 1 that is 1 at local node 0 (global node 2)

.. and zero at all other nodes in element 1, and (ii)

.. the Lagrange

.. polynomial on element 1 that is 1 at local node 2 (global node 2)

.. and zero at all other nodes in element 0. Outside the elements that

.. share global node 2, :math:`\varphi_2(x)=0`. The same reasoning is applied to

.. the construction of :math:`\varphi_4(x)` and :math:`\varphi_6(x)`.

   *Illustration of the piecewise linear basis functions associated with nodes in element 1*


Example on linear :math:`\varphi_i`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P1` shows
piecewise linear basis functions (:math:`d=1`). Also here we have four elements on
:math:`\Omega = [0,1]`. Consider the element :math:`\Omega^{(1)}=[0.25,0.5]`.
Now there are no internal nodes in the elements so that all basis
functions are associated with nodes at the element boundaries and hence
made up of two Lagrange polynomials from neighboring elements.
For example, :math:`\varphi_1(x)` results from the Lagrange polynomial in
element 0 that is 1 at local node 1 and 0 at local node 0, combined with
the Lagrange polynomial in
element 1 that is 1 at local node 0 and 0 at local node 1.
The other basis functions are constructed similarly.

Explicit mathematical formulas are needed for :math:`\varphi_i(x)` in computations.
In the
piecewise linear case, one can show that


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula1
        
        \varphi_i(x) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        0, & x < x_{i-1},\\
        (x - x_{i-1})/(x_{i} - x_{i-1}),
        & x_{i-1} \leq x < x_{i},\\
        1 -
        (x - x_{i})/(x_{i+1} - x_{i}),
        & x_{i} \leq x < x_{i+1},\\
        0, & x\geq x_{i+1}\thinspace . \end{array}
        \right.
        
        

Here, :math:`x_{j}`, :math:`j=i-1,i,i+1`, denotes the coordinate of node :math:`j`.
For elements of equal length :math:`h` the formulas can be simplified to


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2
        
        \varphi_i(x) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        0, & x < x_{i-1},\\
        (x - x_{i-1})/h,
        & x_{i-1} \leq x < x_{i},\\
        1 -
        (x - x_{i})/h,
        & x_{i} \leq x < x_{i+1},\\
        0, & x\geq x_{i+1}
        \end{array}
        \right.
        
        



Example on cubic :math:`\varphi_i`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Piecewise cubic basis functions can be defined by introducing four
nodes per element. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P3` shows
examples on :math:`\varphi_i(x)`, :math:`i=3,4,5,6`, associated with element number 1.
Note that :math:`\varphi_4` and :math:`\varphi_5` are nonzero on element number 1,
while
:math:`\varphi_3` and :math:`\varphi_6` are made up of Lagrange polynomials on two
neighboring elements.

   :width: 600

   *Illustration of the piecewise cubic basis functions associated with nodes in element 1*


We see that all the piecewise linear basis functions have the same
"hat" shape. They are naturally referred to as *hat functions*,
also called *chapau functions*.
The piecewise quadratic functions in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2`
are seen to be of two types. "Rounded hats" associated with internal
nodes in the elements and some more "sombrero" shaped hats associated
with element boundary nodes. Higher-order basis functions also have
hat-like shapes, but the functions have pronounced oscillations in addition,
as illustrated in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P3`.


.. index:: linear elements

.. index:: quadratic elements

.. index:: P1 element

.. index:: P2 element


A common terminology is to speak about *linear elements* as
elements with two local nodes and where the basis functions are
piecewise linear. Similarly, *quadratic elements* and
*cubic elements* refer to piecewise quadratic or cubic functions
over elements with three or four local nodes, respectively.
Alternative names, frequently used later, are P1 elements for linear
elements, P2 for quadratic elements, and so forth (P$d$ signifies
degree :math:`d` of the polynomial basis functions).

.. _fem:approx:global:linearsystem:

Calculating the linear system
-----------------------------

The elements in the coefficient matrix and right-hand side, given
by the formulas (:ref:`fem:approx:Aij`) and (:ref:`fem:approx:bi`),
will now be calculated for piecewise polynomial basis
functions. Consider P1 (piecewise linear) elements. Nodes and elements
numbered consecutively from left to right imply the nodes
:math:`x_i=ih` and the elements


.. math::
        
        \Omega^{(i)} = [x_{i},x_{i+1}] = [ih, (i+1)h],\quad
        i=0,\ldots,N-1
        \thinspace .
        

We have in this case :math:`N` elements and :math:`N+1` nodes,
and :math:`\Omega=[x_{0},x_{N}]`.
The formula for :math:`\varphi_i(x)` is given by
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2` and a graphical illustration is
provided in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P1`.  First we clearly see
from Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P1` that the important property
:math:`\varphi_i(x)\varphi_j(x)\neq 0` if and only if :math:`j=i-1`, :math:`j=i`, or
:math:`j=i+1`, or alternatively expressed, if and only if :math:`i` and :math:`j` are
nodes in the same element. Otherwise, :math:`\varphi_i` and :math:`\varphi_j` are
too distant to have an overlap and consequently a nonzero product.

The element :math:`A_{i,i-1}` in the coefficient matrix can be calculated as


.. math::
        
        \int_\Omega \varphi_i\varphi_{i-1}dx = \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i}}
        \left(1 - \frac{x - x_{i-1}}{h}\right)\frac{x - x_{i}}{h} dx =
        \frac{h}{6}
        \thinspace .
        

It turns out that :math:`A_{i,i+1} =h/6` as well and that
:math:`A_{i,i}=2h/3`. The numbers are modified for :math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N`:
:math:`A_{0,0}=h/3` and :math:`A_{N,N}=h/3`.
The general formula for the right-hand side becomes


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:bi:formula1
        
        b_i = \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i}} \frac{x - x_{i-1}}{h} f(x)dx
        + \int_{x_{i}}^{x_{i+1}} \left(1 - \frac{x - x_{i}}{h}\right) f(x)dx\thinspace .
        
        

With two equal-sized elements in :math:`\Omega=[0,1]` and :math:`f(x)=x(1-x)`, one gets


.. math::
        
        A = \frac{h}{6}\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
        2 & 1 & 0\\
        1 & 4 & 1\\
        0 & 1 & 2
        \end{array}\right),\quad
        b = \frac{h^2}{12}\left(\begin{array}{c}
        2 - 3h\\
        12 - 14h\\
        10 -17h
        \end{array}\right)\thinspace .
        

The solution becomes


.. math::
         c_0 = \frac{h^2}{6},\quad c_1 = h - \frac{5}{6}h^2,\quad
        c_2 = 2h - \frac{23}{6}h^2\thinspace . 

The resulting function


.. math::
         u(x)=c_0\varphi_0(x) + c_1\varphi_1(x) + c_2\varphi_2(x)

is displayed in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:ls:P1:2:4` (left).
Doubling the number of elements to four leads to the improved
approximation in the right part of Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:ls:P1:2:4`.

   *Least squares approximation using 2 (left) and 4 (right) P1 elements*



.. _fem:approx:fe:elementwise:

Assembly of elementwise computations
------------------------------------

The integrals are naturally split into integrals over individual elements
since the formulas change with the elements. This idea of splitting the
integral is fundamental in all practical implementations of the finite
element method.

Let us split the integral over :math:`\Omega` into a sum of contributions from
each element:


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:elementwise:Asplit
        
        A_{i,j} = \int_\Omega\varphi_i\varphi_jdx = \sum_{e} A^{(e)}_{i,j},\quad
        A^{(e)}_{i,j}=\int_{\Omega^{(e)}} \varphi_i\varphi_jdx\thinspace .
        
        

Now, :math:`A^{(e)}_{i,j}\neq 0` if and only if :math:`i` and :math:`j` are nodes in element
:math:`e`. Introduce :math:`i=q(e,r)` as the mapping of local node number :math:`r` in element
:math:`e` to the global node number :math:`i`. This is just a short mathematical notation
for the expression ``i=elements[e][r]`` in a program.
Let :math:`r` and :math:`s` be the local node numbers corresponding to the global
node numbers :math:`i=q(e,r)` and
:math:`j=q(e,s)`. With :math:`d` nodes per element, all the nonzero elements
in :math:`A^{(e)}_{i,j}` arise from the integrals involving basis functions with
indices corresponding to the global node numbers in element number :math:`e`:


.. index:: element matrix



.. math::
         \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}\varphi_{q(e,r)}\varphi_{q(e,s)}dx,\quad r,s=0,\ldots, d\thinspace .
        

These contributions can be collected in a :math:`(d+1)\times (d+1)` matrix known as
the *element matrix*.
We introduce the notation


.. math::
         \tilde A^{(e)} = \{ \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s}\},\quad r,s=0,\ldots,d,

for the element matrix. For the case :math:`d=2` we have

.. math::
        
        \tilde A^{(e)} = \left\lbrack\begin{array}{lllll}
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{0,0} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{0,1} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{0,2}\\
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{1,0} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{1,1} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{1,2}\\
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{2,0} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{2,1} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{2,2}
        \end{array}\right\rbrack
        \thinspace .
        

Given the numbers :math:`\tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s}`,
we should according to :eq:`fem:approx:fe:elementwise:Asplit`
add the contributions to the global coefficient matrix by


.. math::
        
         A_{q(e,r),q(e,s)} := A_{q(e,r),q(e,s)} + \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s},\quad
        r,s=0,\ldots,d\thinspace . 

This process of adding in elementwise contributions to the global matrix
is called *finite element assembly* or simply *assembly*.
.. index:: assembly

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:assembly` illustrates how element matrices
for elements with two nodes are added into the global matrix.
More specifically, the figure shows how the element matrix associated with
elements 2 and 3 assembled, assuming that global nodes are numbered
from left to right in the domain.



.. _fem:approx:fe:fig:assembly:

.. figure:: fig-fem/matrix-assembly.png
   :width: 600

   *Illustration of matrix assembly*


The right-hand side of the linear system is also computed elementwise:


.. math::
        
        b_i = \int_\Omega\varphi_i\varphi_jdx = \sum_{e} b^{(e)}_{i},\quad
        b^{(e)}_{i}=\int_{\Omega^{(e)}} f(x)\varphi_i(x)dx\thinspace . 

We observe that
:math:`b_i^{(e)}\neq 0` if and only if global node :math:`i` is a node in element :math:`e`.
With :math:`d` nodes per element we can collect the :math:`d+1` nonzero contributions
:math:`b_i^{(e)}`, for :math:`i=q(e,r)`, :math:`r=0,\ldots,d`, in an *element vector*


.. math::
         \tilde b_r^{(e)}=\{ \tilde b_r^{(e)}\},\quad r=0,\ldots,d\thinspace . 

These contributions are added to the
global right-hand side by an assembly process similar to that for the
element matrices:


.. math::
        
        b_{q(e,r)} := b_{q(e,r)} + \tilde b^{(e)}_{r},\quad
        r,s=0,\ldots,d\thinspace . 



.. _fem:approx:fe:mapping:

Mapping to a reference element
------------------------------


.. index:: affine mapping

.. index::
   single: mapping of reference cells; affine mapping


Instead of computing the integrals


.. math::
         \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s} = \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}\varphi_{q(e,r)}(x)\varphi_{q(e,s)}(x)dx

over some element
:math:`\Omega^{(e)} = [x_L, x_R]`,
it is convenient to map the element domain :math:`[x_L, x_R]`
to a standardized reference element domain :math:`[-1,1]`.
(We have now introduced
:math:`x_L` and :math:`x_R` as the left and right boundary points of an arbitrary element.
With a natural numbering of nodes and elements from left to right
through the domain, :math:`x_L=x_{e}` and :math:`x_R=x_{e+1}`.)
Let :math:`X` be the coordinate
in the reference element. A linear or *affine mapping* from :math:`X` to :math:`x` reads


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:affine:mapping
        
        x = \frac{1}{2} (x_L + x_R) + \frac{1}{2} (x_R - x_L)X\thinspace .
        
        

This relation can alternatively be expressed by

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:affine:mapping2
        
        x = x_m + \frac{1}{2}hX,
        
        

where we have introduced the element midpoint :math:`x_m=(x_L+x_R)/2` and
the element length :math:`h=x_R-x_L`.

Integrating on
the reference element is a matter of just changing the integration
variable from :math:`x` to :math:`X`. Let


.. math::
        
        \tilde\varphi_r(X) = \varphi_{q(e,r)}(x(X))
        

be the basis function associated with local node number :math:`r` in the
reference element. The integral transformation reads


.. math::
        
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s} = \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}\varphi_{q(e,r)}(x)\varphi_{q(e,s)}(x)dx
        = \int_{-1}^1 \tilde\varphi_r(X)\tilde\varphi_s(X)\frac{dx}{dX}dX\thinspace . 

The stretch factor :math:`dx/dX` between the :math:`x` and :math:`X` coordinates
becomes the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the mapping
between the coordinate systems in 2D and 3D. To obtain a uniform
notation for 1D, 2D, and 3D problems we therefore replace
:math:`dx/dX` by :math:`\det J` already now. In 1D, :math:`\det J = dx/dX = h/2`.
The integration over the reference element is then written as


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:mapping:Ae
        
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s}
        = \int_{-1}^1 \tilde\varphi_r(X)\tilde\varphi_s(X)\det J\,dX
        
        \thinspace .
        

The corresponding formula for the element vector entries becomes


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:mapping:be
        
        \tilde b^{(e)}_{r} = \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}f(x)\varphi_{q(e,r)}(x)dx
        = \int_{-1}^1 f(x(X))\tilde\varphi_r(X)\det J\,dX
        
        \thinspace .
        


Since we from now on will work in the reference
element, we need explicit mathematical formulas for the basis
functions :math:`\varphi_i(x)` in the reference element only, i.e., we only need
to specify formulas for :math:`\tilde\varphi_r(X)`.
This is a very convenient simplification compared to specifying
piecewise polynomials in the physical domain.

The :math:`\tilde\varphi_r(x)` functions are simply the Lagrange
polynomials defined through the local nodes in the reference element.
For :math:`d=1` and two nodes per element, we have the linear Lagrange
polynomials


.. math::
        
        \tilde\varphi_0(X) &= \frac{1}{2} (1 - X)
        \\
        \tilde\varphi_1(X) &= \frac{1}{2} (1 + X)
        
        

Quadratic polynomials, :math:`d=2`, have the formulas


.. math::
        
        \tilde\varphi_0(X) &= \frac{1}{2} (X-1)X\\
        \tilde\varphi_1(X) &= 1 - X^2\\
        \tilde\varphi_2(X) &= \frac{1}{2} (X+1)X
        

In general,


.. math::
        
        \tilde\varphi_r(x) = \prod_{s=0,s\neq r}^d \frac{X-X_{(s)}}{X_{(r)}-X_{(s)}},
        

where :math:`X_{(0)},\ldots,X_{(d)}` are the coordinates of the local nodes in
the reference element.
These are normally uniformly spaced: :math:`X_{(r)} = -1 + 2r/d`,
:math:`r=0,\ldots,d`.

.. _fem:approx:fe:intg:ref:

Integration over a reference element
------------------------------------

To illustrate the concepts from the previous section in a specific
example, we now
consider calculation of the element matrix and vector for a specific choice of
:math:`d` and :math:`f(x)`. A simple choice is :math:`d=1` and :math:`f(x)=x(1-x)`
on :math:`\Omega =[0,1]`. We have the general expressions
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:mapping:Ae` and :eq:`fem:approx:fe:mapping:be`
for :math:`\tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s}` and :math:`\tilde b^{(e)}_{r}`.
Writing these out for the choices (:ref:`fem:approx:fe:mapping:P1:phi0`)
and (:ref:`fem:approx:fe:mapping:P1:phi1`), and using that :math:`\det J = h/2`,
we get


.. math::
        
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{0,0}
        &= \int_{-1}^1 \tilde\varphi_0(X)\tilde\varphi_0(X)\frac{h}{2} dX\nonumber\\
        &=\int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{2}(1-X)\frac{1}{2}(1-X) \frac{h}{2} dX =

        &=\int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{2}(1+X)\frac{1}{2}(1-X) \frac{h}{2} dX =
        \frac{h}{8}\int_{-1}^1 (1-X^2) dX = \frac{h}{6},\\

        \tilde A^{(e)}_{1,1}
        &= \int_{-1}^1 \tilde\varphi_1(X)\tilde\varphi_1(X)\frac{h}{2} dX\nonumber\\

        \frac{h}{8}\int_{-1}^1 (1+X)^2 dX = \frac{h}{3}
        \thinspace .
        



.. math::
        
        \tilde b^{(e)}_{0}
        &= \int_{-1}^1 f(x(X))\tilde\varphi_0(X)\frac{h}{2} dX\nonumber\\
        &= \int_{-1}^1 (x_m + \frac{1}{2} hX)(1-(x_m + \frac{1}{2} hX))
        \frac{1}{2}(1-X)\frac{h}{2} dX \nonumber\\
        &= - \frac{1}{24} h^{3} + \frac{1}{6} h^{2} x_{m} - \frac{1}{12} h^{2} - \frac{1}{2} h x_{m}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} h x_{m}
        \tilde b^{(e)}_{1}\\
        &= \int_{-1}^1 f(x(X))\tilde\varphi_0(X)\frac{h}{2} dX\nonumber\\
        &= \int_{-1}^1 (x_m + \frac{1}{2} hX)(1-(x_m + \frac{1}{2} hX))
        \frac{1}{2}(1+X)\frac{h}{2} dX \nonumber\\
        &= - \frac{1}{24} h^{3} - \frac{1}{6} h^{2} x_{m} + \frac{1}{12} h^{2} -
        \frac{1}{2} h x_{m}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} h x_{m}
        \thinspace .
        

In the last two expressions we have used the element midpoint :math:`x_m`.

Integration of lower-degree polynomials above is tedious,
and higher-degree polynomials that very much more algebra, but ``sympy``
may help. For example,


.. code-block:: python

        >>> import sympy as sm
        >>> x, x_m, h, X = sm.symbols('x x_m h X')
        >>> sm.integrate(h/8*(1-X)**2, (X, -1, 1))
        h/3
        >>> sm.integrate(h/8*(1+X)*(1-X), (X, -1, 1))
        h/6
        >>> x = x_m + h/2*X
        >>> b_0 = sm.integrate(h/4*x*(1-x)*(1-X), (X, -1, 1))
        >>> print b_0
        -h**3/24 + h**2*x_m/6 - h**2/12 - h*x_m**2/2 + h*x_m/2

For inclusion of formulas in documents 9like the present one), ``sympy`` can print
expressions in LaTeX format:


.. code-block:: python

Implementation (1)
==================

Based on the experience from the previous example, it makes
sense to write some code to automate the integration process
for any choice of finite element basis functions. In addition,
we can automate the assembly process and linear system
solution. Appropriate
functions for this purpose document all details of all
steps in the finite element computations and can found in the module file
`fe_approx1D.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/fem/fe_approx1D.py>`_. Some of the functions are explained below.

.. _fem:approx:fe:impl:intg:

Integration
-----------

First we need a Python function for
defining :math:`\tilde\varphi_r(X)` in terms of a Lagrange polynomial
of degree ``d``:


.. code-block:: python

        import sympy as sm
        import numpy as np
        
        def phi_r(r, X, d):
            if isinstance(X, sm.Symbol):
                h = sm.Rational(1, d)  # node spacing
                nodes = [2*i*h - 1 for i in range(d+1)]
            else:
                # assume X is numeric: use floats for nodes
                nodes = np.linspace(-1, 1, d+1)
            return Lagrange_polynomial(X, r, nodes)
        
        def Lagrange_polynomial(x, i, points):
            p = 1
            for k in range(len(points)):
                if k != i:
                    p *= (x - points[k])/(points[i] - points[k])
            return p

Observe how we construct the ``phi_r`` function to be
a symbolic expression for :math:`\tilde\varphi_r(X)` if ``X`` is a
``Symbol`` object from ``sympy``. Otherwise, we assume that ``X``
is a ``float`` object and compute the corresponding
floating-point value of :math:`\tilde\varphi_r(X)`. The
``Lagrange_polynomial`` function, copied here
from the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:Fourier`,
works with both symbolic and
numeric ``x`` and ``points`` variables.

The complete basis :math:`\tilde\varphi_0(X),\ldots,\tilde\varphi_d(X)`
on the reference element is constructed by


.. code-block:: python

        def basis(d=1):
            X = sm.Symbol('X')
            phi = [phi_r(r, X, d) for r in range(d+1)]
            return phi

Now we are in a position to write the function for computing
the element matrix:


.. code-block:: python

        def element_matrix(phi, Omega_e, symbolic=True):
            n = len(phi)
            A_e = sm.zeros((n, n))
            X = sm.Symbol('X')
            if symbolic:
                h = sm.Symbol('h')
            else:
                h = Omega_e[1] - Omega_e[0]
            detJ = h/2  # dx/dX
            for r in range(n):
                for s in range(r, n):
                    A_e[r,s] = sm.integrate(phi[r]*phi[s]*detJ, (X, -1, 1))
                    A_e[s,r] = A_e[r,s]
            return A_e

In the symbolic case (``symbolic`` is ``True``),
we introduce the element length as a symbol
``h`` in the computations. Otherwise, the real numerical value
of the element interval ``Omega_e``
is used and the final matrix elements are numbers,
not symbols.
This functionality can be demonstrated:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> from fe_approx1D import *
        >>> phi = basis(d=1)
        >>> phi
        [1/2 - X/2, 1/2 + X/2]
        >>> element_matrix(phi, Omega_e=[0.1, 0.2], symbolic=True)
        [h/3, h/6]
        [h/6, h/3]
        >>> element_matrix(phi, Omega_e=[0.1, 0.2], symbolic=False)
        [0.0333333333333333, 0.0166666666666667]
        [0.0166666666666667, 0.0333333333333333]


The computation of the element vector is done by a similar
procedure:


.. code-block:: python

        def element_vector(f, phi, Omega_e, symbolic=True):
            n = len(phi)
            b_e = sm.zeros((n, 1))
            # Make f a function of X
            X = sm.Symbol('X')
            if symbolic:
                h = sm.Symbol('h')
            else:
                h = Omega_e[1] - Omega_e[0]
            x = (Omega_e[0] + Omega_e[1])/2 + h/2*X  # mapping
            f = f.subs('x', x)  # substitute mapping formula for x
            detJ = h/2  # dx/dX
            for r in range(n):
                b_e[r] = sm.integrate(f*phi[r]*detJ, (X, -1, 1))
            return b_e

Here we need to replace the symbol ``x`` in the expression for ``f``
by the mapping formula such that ``f`` contains the variable ``X``.

The integration in the element matrix function involves only products
of polynomials, which ``sympy`` can easily deal with, but for the
right-hand side ``sympy`` may face difficulties with certain types of
expressions ``f``. The result of the integral is then an ``Integral``
object and not a number as when symbolic integration is successful.
It may therefore be wise to introduce a fallback on numerical
integration. The symbolic integration can also take much time
before an unsuccessful conclusion so we may introduce a parameter
``symbolic`` and set it to ``False`` to avoid symbolic integration:


.. code-block:: python

        def element_vector(f, phi, Omega_e, symbolic=True):
                ...
                if symbolic:
                    I = sm.integrate(f*phi[r]*detJ, (X, -1, 1))
                if not symbolic or isinstance(I, sm.Integral):
                    h = Omega_e[1] - Omega_e[0]  # Ensure h is numerical
                    detJ = h/2
                    integrand = sm.lambdify([X], f*phi[r]*detJ)
                    I = sm.mpmath.quad(integrand, [-1, 1])
                b_e[r] = I
                ...

Successful numerical integration requires that the symbolic
integrand is converted
to a plain Python function (``integrand``) and that
the element length ``h`` is a real number.

.. _fem:approx:fe:impl:linsys:

Linear system assembly and solution
-----------------------------------

The complete algorithm
for computing and assembling the elementwise contributions
takes the following form


.. code-block:: python

        def assemble(nodes, elements, phi, f, symbolic=True):
            n_n, n_e = len(nodes), len(elements)
            if symbolic:
                A = sm.zeros((n_n, n_n))
                b = sm.zeros((n_n, 1))    # note: (n_n, 1) matrix
            else:
                A = np.zeros((n_n, n_n))
                b = np.zeros(n_n)
            for e in range(n_e):
                Omega_e = [nodes[elements[e][0]], nodes[elements[e][-1]]]
        
                A_e = element_matrix(phi, Omega_e, symbolic)
                b_e = element_vector(f, phi, Omega_e, symbolic)
        
                for r in range(len(elements[e])):
                    for s in range(len(elements[e])):
                        A[elements[e][r],elements[e][s]] += A_e[r,s]
                    b[elements[e][r]] += b_e[r]
            return A, b

The ``nodes`` and ``elements`` variables represent the finite
element mesh as explained earlier.

Given the coefficient matrix ``A`` and the right-hand side ``b``,
we can compute the coefficients :math:`c_0,\ldots,c_N` in the expansion
:math:`u(x)=\sum_jc_j\varphi_j` as the solution vector ``c`` of the linear
system:


.. code-block:: python

        if symbolic:
            c = A.LUsolve(b)
        else:
            c = np.linalg.solve(A, b)

When ``A`` and ``b`` are ``sympy`` arrays,
solution procedure implied by ``A.LUsolve`` is symbolic,
otherwise, when ``A`` and ``b`` are ``numpy`` arrays, a standard
numerical solver is called.
The symbolic version is suited for small problems only
(small :math:`N` values) since the calculation time becomes prohibitively large
otherwise. Normally, the symbolic integration will be more time
consuming in small problems than the symbolic solution of the linear system.

.. _fem:approx:fe:impl:ex1:

Example on computing approximations
-----------------------------------

We can exemplify the use of ``assemble`` on the computational
case from the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:linearsystem` with
two P1 elements (linear basis functions) on the domain :math:`\Omega=[0,1]`.
Let us first work with a symbolic element length:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> h, x = sm.symbols('h x')
        >>> nodes = [0, h, 2*h]
        >>> elements = [[0, 1], [1, 2]]
        >>> phi = basis(d=1)
        >>> f = x*(1-x)
        >>> A, b = assemble(nodes, elements, phi, f, symbolic=True)
        >>> A
        [h/3,   h/6,   0]
        [h/6, 2*h/3, h/6]
        [  0,   h/6, h/3]
        >>> b
        [     h**2/6 - h**3/12]
        [      h**2 - 7*h**3/6]
        [5*h**2/6 - 17*h**3/12]
        >>> c = A.LUsolve(b)
        >>> c
        [                           h**2/6]
        [12*(7*h**2/12 - 35*h**3/72)/(7*h)]
        [  7*(4*h**2/7 - 23*h**3/21)/(2*h)]

We may, for comparison, compute the ``c`` vector for an interpolation or
collocation method, taking the nodes as collocation points.
This is carried out by evaluating ``f`` numerically at the nodes:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> fn = sm.lambdify([x], f)
        >>> c = [fn(xc) for xc in nodes]
        >>> c
        [0, h*(1 - h), 2*h*(1 - 2*h)]


The corresponding numerical computations, as done by ``sympy`` and
still based on symbolic integration, goes as follows:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> nodes = [0, 0.5, 1]
        >>> elements = [[0, 1], [1, 2]]
        >>> phi = basis(d=1)
        >>> x = sm.Symbol('x')
        >>> f = x*(1-x)
        >>> A, b = assemble(nodes, elements, phi, f, symbolic=False)
        >>> A
        [ 0.166666666666667, 0.0833333333333333,                  0]
        [0.0833333333333333,  0.333333333333333, 0.0833333333333333]
        [                 0, 0.0833333333333333,  0.166666666666667]
        >>> b
        [          0.03125]
        [0.104166666666667]
        [          0.03125]
        >>> c = A.LUsolve(b)
        >>> c
        [0.0416666666666666]
        [ 0.291666666666667]
        [0.0416666666666666]


The ``fe_approx1D`` module contains functions for generating the
``nodes`` and ``elements`` lists for equal-sized elements with
any number of nodes per element. The coordinates in ``nodes``
can be expressed either through the element length symbol ``h``
or by real numbers. There is also a function


.. code-block:: python

        def approximate(f, symbolic=False, d=1, n_e=4, filename='tmp.pdf'):

which computes a mesh with ``n_e`` elements, basis functions of
degree ``d``, and approximates a given symbolic expression
``f`` by a finite element expansion :math:`u(x) = \sum_jc_j\varphi_j(x)`.
When ``symbolic`` is ``False``, :math:`u(x)` can be computed at a (large)
number of points and plotted together with :math:`f(x)`. The construction
of :math:`u` points from the solution vector ``c`` is done
elementwise by evaluating :math:`\sum_rc_r\tilde\varphi_r(X)` at a (large)
number of points in each element, and the discrete :math:`(x,u)` values on
each elements are stored in arrays that are finally
concatenated to form global arrays
with the :math:`x` and :math:`u` coordinates for plotting. The details are
found in the ``u_glob`` function in
``fe_approx1D.py``.

.. _fem:approx:fe:A:structure:

The structure of the coefficient matrix
---------------------------------------

Let us first see how the global matrix looks like if we assemble
symbolic element matrices, expressed in terms of ``h``, from
several elements:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> d=1; n_e=8; Omega=[0,1]  # 8 linear elements on [0,1]
        >>> phi = basis(d)
        >>> f = x*(1-x)
        >>> nodes, elements = mesh_symbolic(n_e, d, Omega)
        >>> A, b = assemble(nodes, elements, phi, f, symbolic=True)
        >>> A
        [h/3,   h/6,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,   0]
        [h/6, 2*h/3,   h/6,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,   0]
        [  0,   h/6, 2*h/3,   h/6,     0,     0,     0,     0,   0]
        [  0,     0,   h/6, 2*h/3,   h/6,     0,     0,     0,   0]
        [  0,     0,     0,   h/6, 2*h/3,   h/6,     0,     0,   0]
        [  0,     0,     0,     0,   h/6, 2*h/3,   h/6,     0,   0]
        [  0,     0,     0,     0,     0,   h/6, 2*h/3,   h/6,   0]
        [  0,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,   h/6, 2*h/3, h/6]
        [  0,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,     0,   h/6, h/3]

(The reader is encouraged to assemble the element matrices by hand and verify
this result, as this exercise will give a hands-on understanding of
what the assembly is about.) In general we have a coefficient matrix that is
tridiagonal:



.. math::
        
        A = \frac{h}{6}
        \left(
        \begin{array}{cccccccccc}
        2 & 1 & 0
        &\cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & 0 \\
        1 & 4 & 1 & \ddots &   & &  & &  \vdots \\
        0 & 1 & 4 & 1 &
        \ddots & &  &  & \vdots \\
        \vdots & \ddots &  & \ddots & \ddots & 0 &  & & \vdots \\
        \vdots &  & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & & \vdots \\
        \vdots & &  & 0 & 1 & 4 & 1 & \ddots & \vdots \\
        \vdots & & &  & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots &\ddots  & 0 \\
        \vdots & & & &  &\ddots  & 1  & 4  & 1 \\
        0 &\cdots & \cdots &\cdots & \cdots & \cdots  & 0 & 1 & 2
        \end{array}
        \right)
        



The structure of the right-hand side is more difficult to reveal since
it involves an assembly of elementwise integrals of
:math:`f(x(X))\tilde\varphi_r(X)h/2`, which obviously depend on the
particular choice of :math:`f(x)`.
It is easier to look at the integration in :math:`x` coordinates, which
gives the general formula :eq:`fem:approx:fe:bi:formula1`.
For equal-sized elements of length :math:`h`, we can apply the
Trapezoidal rule at the global node points to arrive at a somewhat more specific
expression than :eq:`fem:approx:fe:bi:formula1`:


.. math::
        
        b_i &= h\left( \frac{1}{2} \phi_i(x_{0})f(x_{0}) +
        \frac{1}{2} \phi_i(x_{N})f(x_{N}) + \sum_{j=1}^{N-1}
        \phi_i(x_{i})f(x_{i})\right)\\
        & =
        \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        \frac{1}{2} hf(x_i),& i=0\hbox{ or }i=N,\\
        h f(x_i), & 1 \leq i \leq N-1
        \end{array}\right.
        

The reason for this simple formula is simply that :math:`\phi_i` is either
0 or 1 at the nodes and 0 at all but one of them.

Going to P2 elements (``d=2``) leads
to the element matrix


.. math::
        
        A^{(e)} = \frac{h}{30}
        \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
        4 & 2 & -1\\
        2 & 16 & 2\\
        -1 & 2 & 4
        \end{array}\right)
        

and the following global assembled matrix from four elements:


.. math::
        
        A = \frac{h}{30}
        \left(
        \begin{array}{ccccccccc}
        4 & 2 & - 1 & 0
          & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
          2 & 16 & 2
          & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\- 1 & 2 &
          8 & 2 & - 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
          0\\0 & 0 & 2 & 16 & 2 & 0 & 0
          & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & - 1 & 2 & 8
          & 2 & - 1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
          2 & 16 & 2 & 0 & 0\\0 & 0 & 0
          & 0 & - 1 & 2 & 8 &
          2 & - 1\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
          2 & 16 & 2\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
          & 0 & - 1 & 2 & 4
        \end{array}
        \right)
        

In general, for :math:`i` odd we have the nonzeroes


.. math::
         A_{i,i-2} = -1,\quad A_{i-1,i}=2,\quad A_{i,i} = 8,\quad A_{i+1,i}=2,
        \quad A_{i+2,i}=-1,

multiplied by :math:`h/30`, and for :math:`i` even we have the nonzeros


.. math::
         A_{i-1,i}=2,\quad A_{i,i} = 16,\quad A_{i+1,i}=2,

multiplied by :math:`h/30`. The rows with odd numbers correspond to
nodes at the element boundaries and get contributions from two
neighboring elements in the assembly process,
while the even numbered rows correspond to
internal nodes in the elements where the only one element contributes
to the values in the global matrix.

Applications
------------

With the aid of the ``approximate`` function in the ``fe_approx1D``
module we can easily investigate the quality of various finite element
approximations to some given functions. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:x9:sin`
shows how linear and quadratic elements approximates the polynomial
:math:`f(x)=x(1-x)^8` on :math:`\Omega =[0,1]`, using equal-sized elements.
The results arise from the program


.. code-block:: python

        import sympy as sm
        from fe_approx1D import approximate
        x = sm.Symbol('x')
        
        approximate(f=x*(1-x)**8, symbolic=False, d=1, n_e=4)
        approximate(f=x*(1-x)**8, symbolic=False, d=2, n_e=2)
        approximate(f=x*(1-x)**8, symbolic=False, d=1, n_e=8)
        approximate(f=x*(1-x)**8, symbolic=False, d=2, n_e=4)

The quadratic functions are seen to be better than the linear ones for the same
value of :math:`N`, as we increase :math:`N`. This observation has some generality:
higher degree is not necessarily better on a coarse mesh, but it is as
we refined the mesh.

Sparse matrix storage and solution
----------------------------------

Some of the examples in the preceding section took several minutes to
compute, even on small meshes consisting of up to eight elements.
The main explanation for slow computations is unsuccessful
symbolic integration: ``sympy`` may use a lot of energy on
integrals like :math:`\int f(x(X))\tilde\varphi_r(X)h/2 dx` before
giving up, and the program resorts to numerical integration.
Codes that can deal with a large number of basis functions and
accept flexible choices of :math:`f(x)` should compute all integrals
numerically and replace the matrix objects from ``sympy`` by
the far more efficient array objects from ``numpy``.

A matrix whose majority of entries are zeros, are known as a *sparse*
matrix. We know beforehand that matrices from finite element
approximations are sparse.  The sparsity should be utilized in
software as it dramatically decreases the storage demands and the
CPU-time needed to compute the solution of the linear system. This
optimization is not critical in 1D problems where modern computers can
afford computing with all the zeros in the complete square matrix, but
in 2D and especially in 3D, sparse matrices are fundamental for
feasible finite element computations.

For one-dimensional finite element approximation problems, using a
numbering of nodes and elements from left to right over the domain,
the assembled coefficient matrix has only a few diagonals different
from zero. More precisely, :math:`2d+1` diagonals are different from
zero. With a different numbering of global nodes, say a random
ordering, the diagonal structure is lost, but the number of
nonzero elements is unaltered. Figures :ref:`fem:approx:fe:sparsity:P1`
and :ref:`fem:approx:fe:sparsity:P3` exemplifies sparsity patterns.

.. _fem:approx:fe:element:

A generalized element concept
=============================


So far, finite element computing has employed the ``nodes`` and
``element`` lists together with the definition of the basis functions
in the reference element. Suppose we want to introduce a piecewise
constant approximation with one basis function :math:`\tilde\varphi_0(x)=1` in
the reference element. Although we could associate the function value
with a node in the middle of the elements, there are no nodes at the
ends, and the previous code snippets will not work because we
cannot find the element boundaries from the ``nodes`` list.

.. _fem:approx:fe:element:terminology:

Cells, vertices, and degrees of freedom
---------------------------------------


.. index:: cell

.. index:: vertex

.. index:: degree of freedom

.. index:: reference cell


We now introduce *cells* as the subdomains :math:`\Omega^{(e)}` previously
referred as elements. The cell boundaries are denoted as *vertices*.
The reason for this name is that cells are recognized by their vertices
in 2D and 3D. Then we define a set of *degrees of freedom*, which are
the quantities we aim to compute. The most common type of degree
of freedom is the value of the unknown function :math:`u` at some point.
For example, we can introduce nodes as before and say the degrees of
freedom are the values of :math:`u` at the nodes. The basis functions are
constructed so that they equal unity for one particular degree of
freedom and zero for the rest. This property ensures that when
we evaluate :math:`u=\sum_j c_j\varphi_j` for degree of freedom number :math:`i`,
we get :math:`u=c_i`. Integrals are performed over cells, usually by
mapping the cell of interest to a *reference cell*.

With the concepts of cells, vertices, and degrees of freedom we increase
the decoupling the geometry (cell, vertices) from the space of
basis functions. We can associate different sets of basis functions
with a cell. In 1D, all cells are intervals, while in 2D we can have
cells that are triangles with straight sides, or any polygon, or in fact
any two-dimensional geometry. Triangles and quadrilaterals are most
common, though. The popular cell types in 3D are tetrahedra and hexahedra.

.. _fem:approx:fe:element:def:

Extended finite element concept
-------------------------------


.. index::
   single: finite element, definition


The concept of a *finite element* is now

  * a *reference cell* in a local reference coordinate system;

  * a set of *basis functions* :math:`\tilde\varphi_i` defined on the cell;

  * a set of *degrees of freedom* that uniquely determine
    the basis functions such that :math:`\tilde\varphi_i=1` for degree of freedom
    number :math:`i` and :math:`\tilde\varphi_i=0` for all other degrees of freedom;

  * a mapping between local and global degree of freedom numbers;

  * a *mapping* of the reference cell onto to cell in the physical
    domain.

There must be a geometric description of a cell. This is trivial in 1D
since the cell is an interval and is described by the interval limits,
here called vertices. If the cell is :math:`\Omega^{(e)}=[x_L,x_R]`,
vertex 0 is :math:`x_L` and vertex 1 is :math:`x_R`. The reference cell in 1D
is :math:`[-1,1]` in the reference coordinate system :math:`X`.

Our previous P1, P2, etc., elements are defined by introducing :math:`d+1`
equally spaced nodes in the reference cell and saying that the degrees
of freedom are the :math:`d+1` function values at these nodes.  The basis
functions must be 1 at one node and 0 at the others, and the Lagrange
polynomials have exactly this property.  The nodes can be numbered
from left to right with associated degrees of freedom that are
numbered in the same way.  The degree of freedom mapping becomes what
was previously represented by the ``elements`` lists.  The cell mapping
is the same affine mapping :eq:`fem:approx:fe:affine:mapping` as
before.


.. index::
   single: finite element expansion; reference element


The expansion of :math:`u` over one cell is often used. In terms of reference
coordinates we have


.. math::
        
        u(x) = \sum_{r} c_r\tilde\varphi_r(X),
        

where the sum is taken over the numbers of the degrees of freedom and
:math:`c_r` is the value of :math:`u` for degree of freedom number :math:`r`.


.. _fem:approx:fe:element:impl:

Implementation (2)
------------------


.. index:: cells list

.. index:: vertices list

.. index:: dof_map list


Implementationwise,

  * we replace ``nodes`` by ``vertices``;

  * we introduce ``cells`` such that ``cell[e][r]`` gives the mapping
    from local vertex ``r`` in cell ``e`` to the global vertex number
    in ``vertices``;

  * we replace ``elements`` by ``dof_map`` (the contents are the same).

Consider the example from the section :ref:`fem:approx:fe:def:elements:nodes`
where :math:`\Omega =[0,1]` is divided into two cells,
:math:`\Omega^{(0)}=[0,0.4]` and :math:`\Omega^{(1)}=[0.4,1]`.
The vertices are :math:`[0,0.4,1]`. Local vertex 0 and 1 are
:math:`0` and :math:`0.4` in cell 0 and :math:`0.4` and :math:`1` in cell 1.
A P2 element means that the degrees of freedom are
the value of :math:`u` at three equally spaced points (nodes) in each
cell. The data structures become


.. code-block:: python

        vertices = [0, 0.4, 1]
        cells = [[0, 1], [1, 2]]
        dof_map = [[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]


If we would approximate :math:`f` by piecewise constants, we simply
introduce one point or node in an element, preferably :math:`X=0`,
and choose :math:`\tilde\varphi_0(X)=1`. Only the ``dof_map`` is altered:


.. code-block:: python

        dof_map = [[0], [1], [2]]


We use the ``cells`` and ``vertices`` lists to retrieve information
on the geometry of a cell, while ``dof_map`` is used in the
assembly of element matrices and vectors.
For example, the ``Omega_e`` variable (representing the cell interval)
in previous code snippets must now be computed as


.. code-block:: python

        Omega_e = [vertices[cells[e][0], vertices[cells[e][1]]

The assembly is done by


.. code-block:: python

        A[dof_map[e][r], dof_map[e][s]] += A_e[r,s]
        b[dof_map[e][r]] += b_e[r]


We will hereafter work with ``cells``, ``vertices``, and ``dof_map``.

.. fe_approx1D_numint.py can be reworked to dof_map

.. augment with P0


Cubic Hermite polynomials
-------------------------

The finite elements considered so far represent :math:`u` as piecewise
polynomials with discontinuous derivatives at the cell boundaries.
Sometimes it is desired to have continuous derivatives. A primary
examples is the solution of differential equations with fourth-order
derivatives where standard finite element formulations lead to
a need for basis functions with continuous first-order derivatives.
The most common type of such basis functions in 1D is the
cubic Hermite polynomials.

There are ready-made formulas for the cubic Hermite polynomials, but
it is instructive to apply the principles for constructing basis
functions in detail.
Given a reference cell :math:`[-1,1]`, we seek cubic polynomials
with the values of the function its first-order derivative at
:math:`X=-1` and :math:`X=1` as the four degrees of freedom. Let us number
the degrees of freedom as

  * 0: value of function at :math:`X=-1`

  * 1: value of first derivative at :math:`X=-1`

  * 2: value of function at :math:`X=1`

  * 3: value of first derivative at :math:`X=1`

The four basis functions can be written in a general form

.. math::
         \tilde\varphi_i (X) = \sum_{j=0}^3 C_{ij}X^j, 

with four coefficients :math:`C_{ij}`, :math:`j=0,1,2,3`, to be determined for
each :math:`i`. The constraints
that basis function number :math:`i` must be 1 for degree of
freedom number :math:`i` and zero for the other three degrees of freedom
gives four equations to determine :math:`C_{ij}` for each :math:`i`. In mathematical
detail,

.. math::
        
        \tilde\varphi_0 (-1) &= 1,\quad \tilde\varphi_0 (1)=\tilde\varphi_0'(-1)=\tilde\varphi_i' (1)=0,\\
        \tilde\varphi_1' (-1) &= 1,\quad \tilde\varphi_1 (-1)=\tilde\varphi_1(1)=\tilde\varphi_1' (1)=0,\\
        \tilde\varphi_2 (1) &= 1,\quad \tilde\varphi_2 (-1)=\tilde\varphi_2'(-1)=\tilde\varphi_2' (1)=0,\\
        \tilde\varphi_3' (1) &= 1,\quad \tilde\varphi_3 (-1)=\tilde\varphi_3'(-1)=\tilde\varphi_3 (1)=0
        \thinspace .
        

The 4 :math:`4\times 4` linear equations can be solved, yielding these formulas
for the cubic basis functions:


.. math::
        
        \tilde\varphi_0(X) &= \\
        \tilde\varphi_1(X) &= \\
        \tilde\varphi_2(X) &= \\
        \tilde\varphi_3(X) &= \\

 * ``dof_map``

 * 4x4 element matrix

Numerical integration
=====================

Finite element codes usually apply numerical approximations to
integrals. Since the integrands in the coefficient matrix often
are (lower-order) polynomials, integration rules that can
integrate polynomials exactly are popular.

The numerical integration rules can be expressed in a common form,


.. math::
        
        \int_{-1}^{1} g(X)dX \approx \sum_{j=0}^M w_j\bar X_j,
        

where :math:`\bar X_j` are *integration points* and :math:`w_j` are
*integration weights*, :math:`j=0,\ldots,M`.
Different rules correspond to different choices of points and weights.

.. _fem:approx:fe:numint1:

Basic integration rules with uniform point distribution
-------------------------------------------------------

Three well-known rules are the *Midpoint* rule,


.. math::
        
        \int_{-1}^{1} g(X)dX \approx 2g(0),\quad \bar X_0=0,\ w_0=2,
        

the *Trapezoidal rule*,


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:numint1:trapez
        
        \int_{-1}^{1} g(X)dX \approx g(-1) + g(1),\quad \bar X_0=-1,\ \bar X_1=1,\ w_0=w_1=1,
         
        

and *Simpson's rule*,


.. math::
        
        \int_{-1}^{1} g(X)dX \approx \frac{1}{3}\left(g(-1) + 4g(0)
        + g(1)\right),
        

where


.. math::
        
        \bar X_0=-1,\ \bar X_1=0,\ \bar X_2=1,\ w_0=w_2=\frac{1}{3},\ w_1=\frac{4}{3}\thinspace . 


For higher accuracy one can divide the reference cell into a set of
subintervals and use the rules above on each subinterval. This approach
results in *composite* rules, well-known from basic introductions
to numerical integration of :math:`\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx`.

Gauss-Legendre rules with optimized points
------------------------------------------

All these rules apply equally spaced points. More accurate rules, for a given
:math:`M`, arise if the location of the points are optimized for polynomial
integrands.
The *Gauss-Legendre rules* (also known as
*Gauss-Legendre quadrature*) constitute one such class of
integration methods. Two widely applied Gauss-Legendre rules in this family
have the choice


.. math::
        
        M=1&:\quad \bar X_0=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}},\
        \bar X_1=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}},\ w_0=w_1=1\\
        M=2&:\quad \bar X_0=-\sqrt{\frac{3}{{5}}},\ \bar X_0=0,\
        \bar X_2= \sqrt{\frac{3}{{5}}},\ w_0=w_2=\frac{5}{9},\ w_1=\frac{8}{9}\thinspace . 

These rules integrate 3rd and 5th degree polynomials exactly.
In general, an :math:`M`-point Gauss-Legendre rule integrates a polynomial
of degree :math:`2M+1` exactly.

.. _fem:approx:2D:

Approximation of functions in 2D
================================

All the concepts and algorithms developed for approximation of 1D functions
:math:`f(x)` can readily be extended to 2D functions :math:`f(x,y)` and 3D functions
:math:`f(x,y,z)`. Basically, the extensions consists of defining basis functions
:math:`\varphi_i(x,y)` or :math:`\varphi_i(x,y,z)` over some domain :math:`\Omega`, and
for the least squares and Galerkin methods, the integration is done over
:math:`\Omega`.

.. _fem:approx:2D:global:

Global basis functions
----------------------

An example will demonstrate the necessary extensions to use global
basis functions and the least squares, Galerkin, or interpolation (collocation)
methods in 2D. The former two lead to linear systems


.. math::
        
        \sum_{j=0}^N A_{i,j}c_j &= b_i,\quad i=0,\ldots,N,
        A_{i,j} &= (\varphi_i,\varphi_j),\\
        b_i &= (f,\varphi_i),
        

where the inner product of two functions :math:`f(x,y)` and :math:`f(x,y)` is defined
completely analogously to the 1D case :eq:`fem:approx:LS:innerprod`:

.. math::
        
        (f,g) = \int_\Omega f(x,y)g(x,y) dx dy
        


Given :math:`\Omega = [0,L_x]\times [0,L_y]` and


.. math::
         f(x,y) = (1+x^2)(1+2y^2),

we want to find :math:`u=\sum_{j=0}^Nc_i\varphi_i(x,y)`.

Constructing 2D basis functions 1D functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One straightforward
way to construct a basis in 2D is to combine
1D basis functions. Say we have the 1D basis


.. math::
         \{ \hat\varphi_0(x),\ldots,\hat\varphi_{N_x}(x)\}
        \thinspace .
        

We can now form 2D basis functions as products of 1D basis functions:
:math:`\hat\varphi_p(x)\hat\varphi_q(y)` for :math:`p=0,\ldots,N_x` and :math:`q=0,\ldots,N_y`.
We can either work with double indices,
:math:`\varphi_{p,q}(x,y) = \hat\varphi_p(x)\hat\varphi_q(y)`, and write


.. math::
         u = \sum_{p=0}^{N_y}\sum_{q=0}^{N_x} c_{p,q}\varphi_{p,q}(x,y),
        

or we may transform the double index :math:`(p,q)` to a single index :math:`i`,
using :math:`i=pN_y + q` or :math:`i=qN_x + p`.

Suppose we choose :math:`\hat\varphi_p(x)=x^p`, and try an approximation with
:math:`N_x=N_y=1`:


.. math::
         \varphi_{0,0}=1,\quad \varphi_{1,0}=x, \quad \varphi_{0,1}=y,
        \quad \varphi_{1,1}=xy
        \thinspace .
        

Using a mapping to one index like :math:`i=qN_x + p`, we get


.. math::
         \varphi_0=1,\quad \varphi_1=x, quad \varphi_2=y,\quad\varphi_3 =xy
        \thinspace .
        


Hand calculations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Straightforward calculations give


.. math::
        
        A_{0,0} &= (\varphi_0,\varphi_0) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}
        \varphi_0(x,y)^2 dx dy = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}dx dy = L_xL_y,\\
        A_{1,0} &= (\varphi_1,\varphi_0) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x} xdxdy =
        \frac{1}{2}L_x^2L_y,\\
        A_{0,1} &= (\varphi_0,\varphi_1) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x} ydxdy =
        \frac{1}{2}L_y^2L_x,\\
        A_{0,1} &= (\varphi_0,\varphi_1) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x} xydxdy =
        \int_0^{L_y}ydy \int_{0}^{L_x} xdx
        \frac{1}{4}L_y^2L_x^2
        \thinspace .
        

The right-hand side vector has the entries


.. math::
        
        b_{0} &= (\varphi_0,f) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}1\cdot (1+x^2)(1+2y^2)dxdy
        = \int_0^{L_y}(1+2y^2)dy \int_{0}^{L_x} (1+x^2)dx\\
        &= (L_y + \frac{2}{3}L_y^3)(L_x + \frac{1}{3}L_x^3)\\
        b_{1} &= (\varphi_1,f) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x} x(1+x^2)(1+2y^2) dxdy =
        \int_0^{L_y}(1+2y^2)dy \int_{0}^{L_x} x(1+x^2)dx\\
        &= (L_y + \frac{2}{3}L_y^3)(\frac{1}{2}L_x^2 + \frac{1}{4}L_x^4)\\
        b_{2} &= (\varphi_2,f) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x} y(1+x^2)(1+2y^2) dxdy =
        \int_0^{L_y}y(1+2y^2)dy \int_{0}^{L_x} (1+x^2)dx\\
        &= (\frac{1}{2}L_y + \frac{1}{2}L_y^4)(L_x + \frac{1}{3}L_x^3)\\
        b_{3} &= (\varphi_2,f) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x} xy(1+x^2)(1+2y^2) dxdy =
        \int_0^{L_y}y(1+2y^2)dy \int_{0}^{L_x} x(1+x^2)dx\\
        &= (\frac{1}{2}L_y^2 + \frac{1}{2}L_y^4)(\frac{1}{2}L_x^2 + \frac{1}{4}L_x^4)
        \thinspace .
        


There is a general pattern in these calculations that we can explore.
An arbitrary matrix entry has the formula


.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} &= (\varphi_i,\varphi_j) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}
        \varphi_i\varphi_j dx dy \\
        &= \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}
        \varphi_{p,q}\varphi_{r,s} dx dy
        = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}
        \hat\varphi_p(x)\hat\varphi_q(y)\hat\varphi_r(x)\hat\varphi_s(y) dx dy\\
        &= \int_0^{L_y} \hat\varphi_q(y)\hat\varphi_s(y)dy
        \int_{0}^{L_x} \hat\varphi_p(x) \hat\varphi_r(x) dx\\
        &= \hat A^{(x)}_{p,r}\hat A^{(y)}_{q,s},
        

where


.. math::
         \hat A^{(x)}_{p,r} = \int_{0}^{L_x} \hat\varphi_p(x) \hat\varphi_r(x) dx,
        \quad
        \hat A^{(y)}_{q,s} = \int_0^{L_y} \hat\varphi_q(y)\hat\varphi_s(y)dy,
        

are matrix entries for one-dimensional approximations and
:math:`i=qN_y+q` and :math:`j=sN_y+r`.

With :math:`\hat\varphi_p(x)=x^p` we have


.. math::
         \hat A^{(x)}_{p,r} = \frac{p+r+1}L_x^{p+r+1},\quad
        \hat A^{(y)}_{q,s} = \frac{q+s+1}L_y^{q+s+1},
        

and


.. math::
         A_{i,j} = \hat A^{(x)}_{p,r} \hat A^{(y)}_{q,s} =
        \frac{p+r+1}L_x^{p+r+1} \frac{q+s+1}L_y^{q+s+1},
        

for :math:`p,r=0,\ldots,N_x` and :math:`q,s=0,\ldots,N_y`.

Corresponding reasoning for the right-hand side leads to


.. math::
        
        b_i &= (\varphi_i,f) = \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}\varphi_i f\,dxdx\\
        &= \int_0^{L_y}\int_{0}^{L_x}\hat\varphi_p(x)\hat\varphi_q(y) f\,dxdx\\
        &= \int_0^{L_y}\hat\varphi_q(y) (1+2y^2)dy
        \int_0^{L_y}\hat\varphi_p(x) x^p (1+x^2)dx\\
        &= \int_0^{L_y} y^q (1+2y^2)dy
        \int_0^{L_y}x^p (1+x^2)dx\\
        &= (\frac{1}{q+1} L_y^{q+1} + \frac{2}{q+3}x^{q+3})
        (\frac{1}{p+1} L_y^{p+1} + \frac{2}{p+3}x^{p+3})

   *Approximation of a 2D quadratic function (left) by a 2D bilinear function (right) using the Galerkin or least squares method*




.. _fem:approx:2D:global:code:

Implementation (3)
------------------

The ``least_squares`` function from
the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:orth` and/or the
file `approx1D.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/fem/fe_approx1D.py>`_
can with very small modifications solve 2D approximation problems.
First, let ``Omega`` now be a list of the intervals in :math:`x` and :math:`y` direction.
For example, :math:`\Omega = [0,L_x]\times [0,L_y]` can be represented
by ``Omega = [[0, L_x], [0, L_y]]``.

Second, the symbolic integration must be extended to 2D:


.. code-block:: python

        import sympy as sm
        
        integrand = phi[i]*phi[j]
        I = sm.integrate(integrand,
                         (x, Omega[0][0], Omega[0][1]),
                         (y, Omega[1][0], Omega[1][1]))

provided ``integrand`` is an expression involving the ``sympy`` symbols ``x``
and ``y``.
The 2D version of numerical integration becomes


.. code-block:: python

        if isinstance(I, sm.Integral):
            integrand = sm.lambdify([x,y], integrand)
            I = sm.mpmath.quad(integrand,
                               [Omega[0][0], Omega[0][1]],
                               [Omega[1][0], Omega[1][1]])

The right-hand side integrals are modified in a similar way.

Third, we must construct a list of 2D basis functions, e.g.,


.. code-block:: python

        def taylor(x, y, Nx, Ny):
            return [x**i*y**j for i in range(Nx+1) for j in range(Ny+1)]
        
        def sines(x, y, Nx, Ny):
            return [sm.sin(sm.pi*(i+1)*x)*sm.sin(sm.pi*(j+1)*y)
                    for i in range(Nx+1) for j in range(Ny+1)]

The complete code appears in
`approx2D.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/fem/fe_approx2D.py>`_.

The previous hand calculation where a quadratic :math:`f` was approximated by
a bilinear function can be computed symbolically by


.. code-block:: python

        >>> f = (1+x**2)*(1+2*y**2)
        >>> phi = taylor(x, y, 1, 1)
        >>> Omega = [[0, 2], [0, 2]]
        >>> u = least_squares(f, phi, Omega)
        >>> print u
        8*x*y - 2*x/3 + 4*y/3 - 1/9
        >>> print sm.expand(f)
        2*x**2*y**2 + x**2 + 2*y**2 + 1

We may continue with adding higher powers to the basis and check that
with :math:`N_x\geq 2` and :math:`N_y\geq 2` we recover the exact function :math:`f`:


.. code-block:: python

        >>> phi = taylor(x, y, 2, 2)
        >>> u = least_squares(f, phi, Omega)
        >>> print u
        8*x*y - 2*x/3 + 4*y/3 - 1/9
        >>> print sm.expand(f)
        2*x**2*y**2 + x**2 + 2*y**2 + 1


Finite elements in 2D and 3D
============================

Finite element approximation is particularly powerful in 2D and 3D because
the method can handle a geometrically complex domain :math:`\Omega` with ease.
The principal idea is, as in 1D, to divide the domain into cells.
Two popular cell shapes are triangles and the quadrilaterals, see
Figures :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:rectP1`, :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:circP1`,
and :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:rectQ1` provide examples.

   :width: 400

   *Examples on 2D Q1 elements*


Basis functions over triangles in the physical domain
-----------------------------------------------------

We start with triangles. A simple choice of approximation is to let
:math:`u` be linear over each triangle, as depicted in Figure
:ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:femfunc`.


.. _fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:femfunc:

.. figure:: fig-fem/demo2D_4x3r.png
   :width: 400

   *Example on piecewise linear 2D functions defined on triangles*


We give the vertices global and local numbers and associate a basis
function :math:`\varphi_i(x,y)` with vertex number :math:`i`:
:math:`\varphi_i(x,y)=1` at this vertex and zero at all others.
Moreover, :math:`\varphi_i(x,y)` is a linear function :math:`a+bx+cy` over each
cell. The
:math:`\varphi_i(x,y)` function is then a combination of planes over all cells
that have vertex number :math:`i` in common. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:basphi`
tries to illustrate the shape of such a "pyramid"-like function.


.. _fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:basphi:

.. figure:: fig-fem/demo2D_basisfunc.png
   :width: 400

   *Example on a piecewise linear 2D basis function over a patch of triangles*


Element matrices and vectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As in 1D, we split the integral over :math:`\Omega` into a sum of integrals
over cells. Also as in 1D, :math:`\varphi_i` can only overlap :math:`\varphi_j`
(i.e., :math:`\varphi_i\varphi_j\neq 0`) if and only if
:math:`i` and :math:`j` are vertices in the same cell. Therefore, the integral
of :math:`\varphi_i\varphi_j` over an element is nonzero only when :math:`i` and :math:`j`
run over the vertex numbers in the element. These nonzero contributions
are, as in 1D, collected in an element matrix.
The size of the element matrix becomes :math:`3\times 3` since there are
three vertex numbers for :math:`i` and :math:`j`. Again, as in 1D, we number the
local vertices in a cell, starting at 0, and add the elements
the element matrix into the global system matrix, exactly as in 1D.
All details and code appear below.


Explicit formulas for the basis functions and their integrals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We shall now provide some formulas for piecewise linear :math:`\varphi_i` functions
and their integrals in the physical coordinate system.
Let :math:`\Omega^{(e)}` be cell number :math:`e`. The three vertices
have global vertex numbers :math:`I=q(e,0)`, :math:`J=q(e,1)`, and :math:`K=q(e,2)`.
The corresponding coordinates are
:math:`(x_{I},y_{I})`, :math:`(x_{J},y_{J})`, and :math:`(x_{K},y_{K})`.
The basis function :math:`\varphi_I` over :math:`\Omega^{(e)}` have the explicit
formula


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:2D:phi:I
        
        \varphi_I (x,y) = \frac{1}{2}\Delta \left( \alpha_I + \beta_Ix
        + \gamma_Iy\right),
        
        

where


.. math::
        
        \alpha_I &= x_{J}y_{K} - x_{K}y_{J},
        \\
        \beta_I &= y_{J} - y_{K},
        \\
        \gamma_I &= x_{K} - x_{J},
        \\
        2\Delta &= \det\left(\begin{array}{rrr}
        1 & x_{I} & y_{I} \\
        1 & x_{J} & y_{J} \\
        1 & x_{K} & y_{K} \end{array}\right),
        
        

The quantity :math:`\Delta` is the area of the cell.

The following formula can often be applied to easily
compute the element matrix:


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:2D:phi:integral
        
        \int_{\Omega^{(e)}} \varphi_I^{p}\varphi_J^{q}\varphi_K^{r} dx dy =
        {p!q!r!\over (p+q+r+2)!}2\Delta
        
        \thinspace .
        

In the present application with approximation, we need this
integral for :math:`p=q=1` and :math:`r=0`, when :math:`I\neq J`, and
:math:`p=2` and :math:`q=r=0`, when :math:`I=J`. The element matrix then becomes


.. math::
        
        \frac{\Delta}{12}
        \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
        2 & 1 & 1\\
        1 & 2 & 1\\
        1 & 1 & 2
        \end{array}\right]
        


.. Limited use before we solve PDEs...



Basis functions over triangles in the reference cell
----------------------------------------------------

As in 1D, we can define the basis functions and the degrees of freedom
in a reference cell and then use a mapping from the reference coordinate
system to the physical coordinate system.
We also have a mapping of local degrees of freedom to global degrees
of freedom.

The reference cell in a :math:`(X,Y)` coordinate system has vertices
:math:`(0,0)`, :math:`(1,0)`, and :math:`(0,1)`, corresponding to local vertex numbers
0, 1, and 2, respectively. The P1 element has linear functions
:math:`\tilde\varphi_r(X,Y)` as basis functions, :math:`r=0,1,2`.
Since a linear function in 2D is on
the form :math:`C_{r,0} + C_{r,1}X + C_{r,2}Y`, and hence has three
parameters :math:`C_{r,0}`, :math:`C_{r,1}X`, and :math:`C_{r,2}Y`, we need three
degrees of freedom, which for the P1 element are the function values at the
vertices. Requiring :math:`\tilde\varphi_r=1` at vertex number :math:`r` and
:math:`\tilde\varphi_r=0` at the two other vertices, gives three linear equations to
determine :math:`C_{r,0}`, :math:`C_{r,1}X`, and :math:`C_{r,2}Y`. The result is


.. math::
        
        \tilde\varphi_0(X,Y) &= 1 - X - Y,\\
        \tilde\varphi_1(X,Y) &= X,\\
        \tilde\varphi_2(X,Y) &= Y
        

The element is depicted in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P12D`.


.. _fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P12D:

   :width: 100

   *2D P1 element*


Higher-order approximations are obtained by increasing the polynomial order,
adding additional points (nodes), and letting the degrees of freedom be
function values at the points. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P22D`
shows the six points (nodes) in the P2 element that are needed to uniquely
determine quadratic basis functions.


.. _fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P22D:

   :width: 100

   *2D P2 element*


A polynomial of degree :math:`p` in :math:`X` and :math:`Y` has :math:`n_p=(p+1)(p+2)/2` terms
and hence needs :math:`n_p` points (nodes). The location of the points for
:math:`\tilde\varphi_r` up to degree 6 is displayed in Figure
:ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P162D`.

   :width: 400

   *2D P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6 elements*


The generalization to 3D is straightforward: the reference element is a
`tetrahedron <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron>`_
with vertices :math:`(0,0,0)`, :math:`(1,0,0)`, :math:`(0,1,0)`, and :math:`(0,0,1)`
in a :math:`X,Y,Z` reference coordinate system. The P1 element has its degrees
of freedom as function values at the vertices, see Figure
:ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P1:123D`, while the P2 element adds additional
points (nodes) along the edges and faces of the cell as depicted in
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:2D:fig:P2:123D`.

The interval in 1D, the triangle in 2D, the tetrahedron in 3D, and
its generalizations to higher space dimensions are known
as *simplex* cells (the geometry) or *simplex* elements (the geometry,
basis functions, degrees of freedom, etc.). The plural form
`simplices <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex>`_ or
simplexes is
also a much used term when referring to this type of cells or elements.
The side of a simplex is called a *face*, while the tetrahedron also
has *edges*.

Affine mapping of the reference cell
------------------------------------

Let :math:`\tilde\varphi_r^{(1)}` denote the basis functions associated
with the P1 element in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and let :math:`\pmb{x}_{q(e,r)}` be
the physical coordinates of local vertex number :math:`r` in cell :math:`e`.
Furthermore,
let :math:`\pmb{X}` be a point in the reference coordinate system corresponding
to the point :math:`\pmb{x}` in the physical coordinate system.
The affine mapping of any :math:`\pmb{X}` onto :math:`\pmb{x}` is
then defined by


.. index:: affine mapping



.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:affine:map
        
        \pmb{x} = \sum_{r} \tilde\varphi_r^{(1)}(\pmb{X})\pmb{x}_{q(e,r)},
        
        

where :math:`r` runs over the vertices in the cell.


.. index:: isoparametric mapping

.. index::
   single: mapping of reference cells; isoparametric mapping


Isoparametric mapping of the reference cell
-------------------------------------------

Instead of using the P1 basis functions in the mapping :ref:`fem:approx:fe:affine:map`, regardless of the degree of the basis functions on the element,
we may use the basis functions themselves:


.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:isop:map
        
        \pmb{x} = \sum_{r} \tilde\varphi_r(\pmb{X})\pmb{x}_{q(e,r)},
        
        

where :math:`r` runs over all nodes, i.e., all points associated with the
degrees of freedom. This is called an *isoparametric mapping*.
For P1 elements it is identical to the affine mapping
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:affine:map`, but for higher-order elements
the mapping of the straight faces of the reference cell will
result in a *curved* face in the physical coordinate system.
For example, when we use the basis functions of the triangular P2 element
in 2D in :eq:`fem:approx:fe:isop:map`, the straight faces of the
reference triangle are mapped onto curved sides of parabolic shape in
the physical coordinate system.


From :eq:`fem:approx:fe:affine:map` or
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:isop:map` it is easy to realize that the
vertices are correctly mapped. Consider a vertex with local number
also a much used term when referring to this type of cells or elements$s$.
Then :math:`\tilde\varphi_s=1` at this vertex and zero at the others.
This means that only one term in the sum is nonzero and :math:`\pmb{x}=\pmb{x}_{q(e,s)}`,
which is the coordinate of this vertex in the global coordinate system.


Computing integrals
-------------------

Let :math:`\Omega^{\mbox{ref}}` denote the reference cell and :math:`\Omega^{(e)}`
the cell in the physical coordinate system. The transformation of
the integral from the physical to the reference coordinate system reads


.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}\varphi_i (\pmb{x}) \varphi_j (\pmb{x}) d\pmb{x} &=
        \int_{\Omega^{\mbox{ref}}} \tilde\varphi_i (\pmb{X}) \tilde\varphi_j (\pmb{X})
        \det J\, d\pmb{X},\\
        \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}\varphi_i (\pmb{x}) f(\pmb{x}) d\pmb{x} &=
        \int_{\Omega^{\mbox{ref}}} \tilde\varphi_i (\pmb{X}) f(\pmb{x}(\pmb{X})) \det J\, d\pmb{X},
        

where :math:`d\pmb{x} = dxdy` in 2D and :math:`d\pmb{x} = dxdydz` in 3D, with a similar
definition of :math:`d\pmb{X}`. The quantity :math:`\det J` is the determinant of the
Jacobian of the mapping :math:`\pmb{x}(\pmb{X})`. In 2D,


.. math::
         J = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
        \frac{\partial x}{\partial X} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial Y}\\
        \frac{\partial y}{\partial X} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial Y}
        \end{array}\right], \quad
        \det J = \frac{\partial x}{\partial X}\frac{\partial y}{\partial Y}
        - \frac{\partial x}{\partial Y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial X}
        \thinspace .
        

With the affine mapping
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:affine:map`, :math:`\det J=2\Delta`, where :math:`\Delta` is
the area or volume of the cell in the physical coordinate system.

*Remark.* Observe that finite elements in 2D and 3D builds on the same
ideas and concepts as in 1D, but there is simply more to compute because the
specific mathematical formulas in 2D and 3D are more complicated.

Exercise 8: Define finite element meshes
----------------------------------------

.. This exercise applies element/node terminology!


Consider a domain :math:`\Omega =[0,2]` divided into the three elements
:math:`[0,1]`, :math:`[1,1.2]`, and :math:`[1.2,2]`, with two nodes in each element
(P1 elements).
Suggest two different element numberings and global node numberings
for this mesh and set up the corresponding ``nodes`` and ``elements``
lists in each case.

Thereafter, subdivide the element :math:`[1.2,2]` into two new equal-sized elements.
Add the new node and the two new elements to each of the ``nodes`` and
``elements`` lists.

Exercise 9: Construct matrix sparsity patterns
----------------------------------------------

:ref:`fem:approx:fe:exer:defmesh` describes a element mesh
with a total of five elements, but with two different element and
node orderings. For each of the two orderings,
make a :math:`5\times 5` matrix and fill in the entries that will be nonzero.
Filename: ``fe_sparsity_pattern.pdf``.

*Hint.* A matrix entry :math:`(i,j)` is nonzero if :math:`i` and :math:`j` are nodes in the
same element.

Solve the system and compare :math:`u(\pi/2` with

Exercise 13: Investigate the approximation errors in finite elements
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A fundamental question is how accurate the finite element approximation
is in terms of the cell length :math:`h` and the degree :math:`d` of the basis
functions. We can investigate this empirically by choosing an :math:`f`
function, say :math:`f(x) = A\sin (\omega x)` on
:math:`\Omega=[0, 2\pi/\omega]`, and compute the approximation error
for a series of :math:`h` and :math:`d` values. The theory predicts that the
error should behave as :math:`h^{d+1}`. Use experiments to verify this
asymptotic behavior (i.e., for small enough :math:`h`).

Exercise 14: Approximate a step function by finite elements
-----------------------------------------------------------

Approximate the step function


.. math::
         f(x) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        1 & x < {1/2},\\
        2 & x \geq {1/2}
        \end{array}\right.
        

by 2, 4, and 8 P1 and P2 elements. Compare
approximations visually.
Filename: ```Heaviside_approx_P1P2.py``.`.

*Hint.* This :math:`f` can also be expressed in terms of the Heaviside function :math:`H(x)`:
:math:`f(x) = H(x-{1/2})`.
Therefore, :math:`f` can be defined by ``f = sm.Heaviside(x -  sm.Rational(1,2))``,
making the ``approximate`` function in the
``fe_approx1D.py`` module an obvious candidate to solve the
problem. However, ``sympy`` does not handle symbolic integration
with this particular integrand, and the ``approximate`` function faces a problem
when converting ``f`` to a Python function (for plotting) since
``Heaviside`` is not an available function in ``numpy``. It is better to make
special-purpose code for this case or perform all
caluclations by hand.

Exercise 15: 2D approximation with orthogonal functions
-------------------------------------------------------

Assume we have basis functions :math:`\varphi_i(x,y)` in 2D that are
orthogonal
such that :math:`(\varphi_i,\varphi_j)=0` when :math:`i\neq j`.
The function ``least_squares`` in the
file `approx2D.py <https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/fem/fe_approx2D.py>`_ will then spend much time on computing off-diagonal terms
in the coefficient matrix that we know are zero.
To speed up the computations, make a
version ``least_squares_orth`` that utilizes the orthogonality among the
basis functions. Apply the function to approximate


.. math::
         f(x,y) = x(1-x)y(1-y)e^{-x-y}

on :math:`\Omega = [0,1]\times [0,1]` via basis functions


.. math::
         \varphi_i(x,y) = \sin (p\pi x)\sin(q\pi y),\quad i=qN_x + p
        \thinspace .
