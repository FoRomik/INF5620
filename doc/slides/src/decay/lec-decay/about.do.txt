======= INF5620 in a nutshell =======
label{5620:about}

 * Numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs)
 * How to we solve a PDE in practice and produce numbers?
 * How to we trust the answer?
 * Approach: *simplify, understand, generalize*

!bsummary After the course
You see a PDE and can't wait to program a method
and visualize a solution! Somebody asks if the solution is right
and you can give convincing answer.

===== Philosophy: simplify, understand, generalize =====

 * Start with simplified ODE/PDE problems
 * Learn to reason about the discretization
 * Learn to implement, verify, and experiment
 * Understand the method, program, and results

===== The exam =====

!bpop
 * Oral exam
 * 6 problems (topics) are announced two weeks before the exam
 * Work out a 20 min presentations (talks) for each problem
 * At the exam: throw a die to pick your problem to be presented
 * Aids: plots, computer programs
 * Why? Very effective way of learning
 * Sure? Excellent results over 15 years
 * When? Late december
