======= How to compile the slides =======

===== Doconce =====

The slides are written in "Doconce":
"https://hplgit.github.io/doconce" syntax and you need the "Doconce
software": "https://github.com/hplgit/doconce" to compile the slides
to LaTeX (and from there to PDF), HTML, Sphinx, various HTML5 formats,
Markdown, IPython notebook, or whatever format is supported by
Doconce.

You may look at "some slides":
"http://hplgit.github.io/teamods/doconce/scientific_writing_reveal.html"
that motivate for Doconce and demonstrates the basic syntax.
A primary advantage of Doconce is that it fixes some of the
problems that HTML/MathJax has with slides in HTML format.

To learn Doconce, browse the tutorial and get to know the manual.  The
"main web page for Doconce":
"http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/web/index.html" is a starting
point.

===== Compile =====

The script `../make_lectures.sh` runs the necessary Doconce commands to
produce slides in various formats:

  * LaTeX Beamer
  * HTML5: deck.js, reveal.js
  * HTML, one large page and one page per slide
  * HTML, solarized style, one large page
  * LaTeX PDF document with the text of all slides (for printing)

Handouts based on Beamer is supported, but not included. It remains to
see if handouts of Beamer slides are inferior or superior to the
LaTeX PDF or the HTML file, etc.

The makefile is run like

!bc sys
Terminal> sh ../make_lectures.sh lecture_decay.do.txt
!ec
if `lecture_decay.do.txt` is the name of the Doconce file that defines
the whole document with lectures.

===== Structure of the documents =====

Suppose the nickname of the set of lectures for a given topic is `decay`.
The main steering file for the lectures is then `lectures_decay.do.txt`.
It basically includes a set of Mako variables (in `../mako_code.txt`)
and a set of files in `lec-decay` with different units of lectures.
It is the files `lec-decay/*.do.txt` that a lecturer wants to edit.
Everything else is generated from this Doconce source.

The Mako variables are used parameterize addresses to web sites used
in the documents. For example, these lectures refers to GitHub
repositories with very long URLs. These have been shortened, but
all details of the URLs are put in Mako variables and used in the
program. This makes the lectures independent of where a lot of
resources for the course are put on the web.
