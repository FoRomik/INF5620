</ul>

<b>Intro.</b> Six problems/topics are given for this exam. For each
problem, the candidate must prepare a 20 min oral presentation. Try to
communicate a good overview and understanding of the topic, but
compose the talk so that you can demonstrate knowledge about details
too. Some of the topics require computations, and you may bring the
program and plots with you on paper or show it using a laptop or
iPad.  Otherwise there are no aids besides a
whiteboard and this document with the exam problems (experience with
this type of exam and various aids tells that learning the content
by heart gives by far the best delivery that demonstrates solid
understanding).

<p>
We will throw die and the number of eyes determines the topic to be
presented. Thereafter, you will be given some questions, either
about parts of your presention or facts from the other topics.
After each presentation, the next candidate can throw the die and
thereby get about 10 min to collect the thoughts before
presenting the assigned topic.

<h3>Problem 1: Falling body  <a name="___sec0"></a></h3>
<p>
The equations for the velocity \( v \) of a very small spherical
body with density \( \varrho \) and radius
\( r \) falling in a fluid with dynamic viscosity \( \mu \) and density \( \varrho_f \)
is

<p>
$$ \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \varrho v'(t) = -\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \varrho g -
6\pi r\mu v + \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\varrho_f g ,$$
where \( g \) is the acceleration of gravity. The initial condition is
\( v(0)=0 \).

<p>

<ol>
<li> Explain briefly how this equation arises from basic principles in
   physics and what the individual terms model.</li>
<li> Derive a Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and a Crank-Nicolson scheme
   for the equation. Mention other possible schemes too.</li>
<li> Illustrate what kind of numerical artifacts that may appear when
   using the Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and a Crank-Nicolson schemes.
   Explain the reason for the artifacts (motivated by a mathematical
   analysis of the schemes).</li>
<li> Which one of the three schemes will you recommend for solving this
   equation with a) large time steps and b) small time steps?</li>
<li> Imagine that somebody claims that the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method
   is superior to the
   Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and a Crank-Nicolson schemes
   both for large and small time steps. Perform numerical experiments to
   assess if this claim is correct. (You may bring with you plots
   or tables to illustrate the results of your investigations.)</li>
<li> The equation above is not a good model if \( \varrho_f vr/\mu \) is much
   greater than 1, which is the case for a body that is not very
   small. How can the model be extended to cover this case?
   Suggest a numerical scheme for the modified equation.</li>
<li> Suppose the shape of the body is much more complicated than a sphere
   so that simple fluid resistance formulas are too inaccurate. Explain
   briefly how one can compute (in principle) a more accurate drag force
   on the body from a detailed flow calculation with PDEs.</li>
</ol>

Subtopics 1-6 constitute the core of this topic, while topic 7 is
add-on information to put the calculations into perspective.
Spend most of the time on subtopics 1-6.

<h3>Problem 2: Heat conduction with finite differences  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>
<p>
The temperature distribution \( T(x,y,z,t) \) in a solid 3D
body \( \Omega \) is governed
by the heat equation

<p>
$$ \varrho c T_t = \nabla\cdot (\alpha(x,y,z)\nabla T),\quad \pmb{x}\in\Omega, t\in (0,T] $$
Here, \( \varrho \) is the density of the body, \( c \) is a measure of
material's heat capacity, \( \alpha \) is the heat conduction coefficient.

<p>
We consider heat conduction in a long cylinder where the sylindrical
surface is isolated such that \( -\alpha\partial T/\partial n=0 \) here.
The cross sections of the end surfaces of the cylinder are kept at
constant temperatures. The left half of the cylinder is made of a material
with heat capacity \( c_0 \) and heat conduction coefficient \( \alpha_0 \),
while the right half has the corresponding constant values \( c_1 \) and
\( \alpha_1 \). A time \( t=0 \) the two pieces, with different temperatures,
are brought together such that the initial temperature field is
\( T_0 \) in the left piece and \( T_1 \) in the right piece. Imagine that
the left and right end points are kept at \( T_0 \) and \( T_1 \),
respectively, at any time \( t>0 \).

<p>

<ol>
<li> Show that the simplification \( T=T(x,t) \) is possible in the described problem,
   where \( x \) is a coordinate along the cylinder (just insert \( T(x,t) \)
   in the original problem and see that it fulfills all equations).
   Set up the simplified
   PDE with proper boundary and initial conditions.</li>
<li> The 1D PDE problem is discretized by the Forward Euler, Backward Euler,
   and Crank-Nicolson schemes. Derive the discrete equations for one
   of these schemes.</li>
<li> Assume for simplicity that \( c_0=c_1 \) and that \( \alpha_0=\alpha_1 \).
   With a discontinuous initial conditions, numerical artifacts may
   appear in the solutions with the three methods. Illustrate
   such artifacts. A suitable program to play around with is
   <a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/diffu/demo_osc.py"><tt>demo_osc.py</tt></a>.</li>
<li> Present the ideas and results of an analysis that can explain the
   artifacts in the previous subproblem.</li>
<li> To what extent are the artifacts from Problem 1 relevant here in Problem 2?</li>
<li> What are the stability restrictions of the various schemes?
<!-- A partial verification of an implementation may be to compute the -->
<!-- analytical solution as \( t\rightarrow\infty \) and check if the numerical -->
<!-- solution reaches the exact solution. -->

<!-- --- begin exercise --></li>
</ol>

<h3>Problem 3: Heat conduction with finite elements  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>
<p>
We consider the same PDE problem as in Problem 2, but this time
solved by finite elements in space. For simplicity you can assume
that \( c \) and \( \alpha \) are constants.

<p>

<ol>
<li> Use a finite difference scheme of your choice in time and
   derive a series of spatial problems. Derive variational formulations
   of these spatial problems.</li>
<li> Use P1 finite elements for the discretization in space. Show
   in detail how the element matrix and vector corresponding to
   the time derivative term or the diffusion term is computed.
   Consider the first an arbitrary element in the interior of the mesh.</li>
<li> Explain how the boundary conditions are incorporated in the
   finite element method. (You may want to compute one matrix for
   the time derivative term and one matrix for the diffusion term.
   At each time level, you form the coefficient matrix of the linear
   system and the right-hand side, and then you may incorporate
   Dirichlet conditions in this system. Alternatively, it is possible
   to prepare the element matrices and vectors so that they
   get the right form wrt Dirichlet conditions after assembly.)</li>
<li> In particular, explain the method of manufactured solutions and how
   it can be used for verification of an implementation of the
   numerical method in this problem.</li>
<li> Compare the difference equations arising from the finite element
   method with the corresponding equations arising from the
   finite difference method by expressing the finite element equations
   in terms of finite difference operators.

</ol>

<h3>Problem 4: Wave equations with finite differences and elements  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>
<p>

<ol>
<li> Set up a wave equation problem in 2D with zero normal derivative
   as boundary condition. Assume a variable wave velocity.</li>
<li> Sketch a physical problem where your mathematical model arises.</li>
<li> Present a finite difference discretization. Explain in particular
   how the boundary conditions and the initial conditions are
   incorporated in the scheme.</li>
<li> Explain (in princple) how the 2D discretization can be extended to 3D.</li>
<li> A pure Python implementation of a 2D or 3D scheme runs slowly.
   Mention ways of speeding up the calculations.</li>
<li> The scheme for the wave equation is perfect for parallel computing.
   Why? What are the principal ideas behind a parallel version of
   the scheme?</li>
<li> Numerical artifacts may occur when solving wave equations.
   Illustrate such artifacts. Sketch an analysis that can explain
   why the artifacts appear.</li>
<li> What are the stability restrictions of the scheme?</li>
<li> Say we solve the wave equation by finite elements. Restrict the
   attention to 1D wave equations and P1 elements. How does the
   finite element method and the finite difference method differ?</li>
<li> Explain why the finite element method is inferior to the
   finite difference method for 1D wave equations. What can be done
   to make the finite element method competitive with finite differences
   in wave equation problems?

</ol>

<h3>Problem 5: Nonlinear diffusion problem  <a name="___sec4"></a></h3>
<p>
Consider the following problem:

<p>
$$ - \frac{d}{dx}\left( \alpha(u)\frac{du}{dx}\right) = f(u),\quad
x\in (0,1),\quad u(0)=0, u(1)=1\thinspace .$$

<p>

<ol>
<li> Formulate a (standard) finite difference method for this problem
   using arithmetic averages of \( \alpha \) where needed.</li>
<li> Derive expressions for the linear system to be solved in each
   Newton iteration.</li>
<li> Derive a variational form for this problem.</li>
<li> Derive an expression for the Jacobian from the variational form.</li>
<li> Compute the discrete nonlinear equations using P1 elements and
   the Trapezoidal rule, and show that the equations are then identical
   to those coming from a finite difference method.</li>
<li> What is the group finite element method and how can it be applied here?
<!-- --- end of exercise -->
<!-- --- begin exercise --></li>
</ol>

<h3>Problem 6: Advanced application  <a name="___sec5"></a></h3>
<p>
Derive a variational form for a <em>system</em> of differential equations
of your choice. Explain how to apply the finite element method and what
the overall computational algorithm for the problem is.
You may find examples from anywhere to illustrate
what type of computations that can be done with the mathematical model.

<p>
Some possibilities based on lectures are

<p>

<ul>
 <li> \( \mu\nabla^2 w = -\beta \), \( \kappa\nabla^2 T = -\mu \nabla w\cdot\nabla w \)</li>
 <li> \( w_t = \nabla\cdot (\mu ||\nabla w||^q \nabla w) + \beta \), \( \kappa\nabla^2 T = -\mu \nabla w\cdot\nabla w \)</li>
 <li> Time-dependent or stationary elasticity</li>
 <li> The Navier-Stokes equations</li>
 <li> The Biot equations (coming)</li>
</ul>

Other possibilities include, e.g., Maxwell's equations, shallow water
wates, Navier-Stokes with a free surface, Navier-Stokes coupled to
temperature, etc.
