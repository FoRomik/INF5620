<h3>Goals: reliable hands-on computing with PDEs  <a name="___sec0"></a></h3>
<p>
When you encounter a partial differential equation, you will after
this course have a clear idea of

<p>

<ul>
  <li> how to view the problem as an assemply of smaller/simplified pieces
  <li> how to formulate a finite difference or finite element method
    for the problem
  <li> how to implement the numerical method in a program
  <li> how to verify that the numerical computations are correct
  <li> how to estimate the reliability of numerical simulations, and
    in particular discover non-physical numerical artifacts
  <li> how different sources of errors play together
</ul>

<h3>Teaching method: simplify, understand, generalize  <a name="___sec1"></a></h3>
<p>
To take advantage of the true power of mathematics in physics,
biology, and other applied sciences, one needs to <em>simplify</em>,
<em>understand</em>, and <em>generalize</em>.  These three concepts also form the
teaching method in this course.

<p>
A series of model problems are addressed and used in examples:

<p>

<ul>
 <li> exponential decay
 <li> vibrating systems
 <li> diffusion
 <li> wave motion
 <li> advection
 <li> elasticity
 <li> viscous flow
 <li> coupled flow, deformation, transport, and/or heat transfer
</ul>

For each model problem, we start out with the simplest version of the
model and go through key building blocks for turning the computer into
a virtual laboratory where we can play around with the model. The
building blocks covered in the course are

<p>

<ul>
 <li> discretization of the model (finite <em>difference</em>, <em>element</em>, volume;
   staggered grids, mixed spaces)
 <li> methods for nonlinear PDEs
 <li> implementation of the discrete model
   (from scratch in 1D, using tools like FEniCS for 2D/3D)
 <li> programming tools: Python, Cython, Python-F77/C++ via f2py and
   Instant, FEniCS, nose, SymPy
 <li> verification of the implementation
 <li> analysis of the discrete model: exact (Fourier) solutions, trunction error
 <li> understanding what can go wrong (numerical artifacts)
 <li> extensions, generalizations, real applications
 <li> scaling, real data with units
 <li> parallel computing
 <li> preconditioned iterative methods for large linear systems
 <li> report writing (LaTeX, HTML/MathJax, Sphinx), reproducibility,
   hg/git, Bitbucket/GitHub
</ul>

Much focus is on <em>all the nuts and bolts of building reliable
simulation models</em>. This means a particular focus on implementation
and testing, and less focus on mathematical subjects that do not
have a direct application of great practical value.

<p>
Through the <em>simplify</em>, <em>understand</em>, and <em>generalize</em> paradigm, one
will view a complex scientific application as an assembly of pieces
that can be understood separately and then brought together (perhaps
with considerable efforts!) to solve the problem in a reliable way.
Our focus throughout the course is two-fold: 1) how to do it, and 2)
how to assess the quality.

<p>
Students must do a 2-week project where the main pieces from the
course, such as time-dependent/nonlinear PDEs, finite elements, FEniCS
programming, verification (convergence rates), critical evaluation of
the method, report writing, etc. are brought together.

<p>
When teaching new methods, we always start out with simple ODEs to
explain the very basics of the technicalities. Then we extend the
methodology progressively using more advanecd models that build on
what we have learned through the simpler ones.  In this way, new
mathematical or programming techniques are introduced in problems of
the simplest possible type (but no simpler!), yet of a relevance that
carries directly over to advanced PDE problems.

<p>

<h3>Files for the course  <a name="___sec2"></a></h3>
<p>
All examples and documentation for the course can be downloaded by
the command
<p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Terminal&gt; git clone git@github.com:hplgit/INF5620.git
</pre></div>
<p>
This gives you a directory <tt>INF5620</tt> with the course material.
This material might be frequently updated. To get the latest version,
go to the <tt>INF5620</tt> directory and run the command
<p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%">Terminal&gt; git pull origin master
</pre></div>
<p>

<p>

<h3>Exam  <a name="___sec3"></a></h3>
<p>
There will be an oral exam. Two weeks prior to the exam six topics
(exercises) are announced. For each topic you must prepare a 20 min
talk (without any aids). In the exam room, you throw a die and the
number of eyes determines which topic you are to present.
You will get some questions after the presentation, about the
selected topic or from the five other topics. You will not get
questions beyond the given six topics.
