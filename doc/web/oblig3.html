<h3>Project 1: 1D wave equation with finite elements  <a name="___sec0"></a></h3>

<p>
The purpose of this project is to derive and analyze a finite element
method for the 1D wave equation

<p>
$$ u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx},\quad x\in [0,L],\ t\in (0,T],$$

with boundary and initial conditions

<p>
$$ u(0,t) = U_0(t),\quad u_x(L,t)=0,\quad u(x,0)=I(0),\quad u_t(x,0)=V(x)
\thinspace .$$


<p>
The analysis will give insight on how to adjust the default behavior
of the finite element method such that its properties are as good as
those for the finite difference method. With the necessary adjustments
discovered in 2D, one gets an accurate
finite element method for simulating 2D and
3D waves in complex geometries.

<p>
<b>a)</b>
Use a finite difference method in time to formulate a sequence of
spatial problems for \( u^n(x) \), \( n=0,1,\ldots,N \).

<p>
<b>b)</b>
Use a Galerkin method to derive a variational form of each of the
spatial problems. Integrate the \( u_{xx} \) term by parts.

<p>
<b>c)</b>
Derive the linear system to be solved at each time level and express
it in the form

<p>
$$ Mc^{n+1} = 2Mc^{n} - Mc^{n-1} + C^2Kc^{n},$$

where \( M \) and \( K \) are matrices, \( C \) is the Courant number,
\( c^n=(c_0^n,c_1^n,\ldots,c^n_{N_x}) \),
\( c_j^n \) being the coefficients in the expansion \( u^n = \sum_{j=0}^{N_x}
c_j\varphi_j(x) \).

<p>
<b>Remark.</b>
Unless \( M \) is diagonal, a (tridiagonal) <em>linear system</em>
must be solved at each time step, whereas the finite difference method
leads to an explicit formula for \( u^{n+1}_i \) at each spatial point at
a new time level.

<p>

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
Group the general expressions
for the linear system according to the above equation and then compute
the actual matrix entries by assembling element matrices for \( M \) and \( K \).

<p>
<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>d)</b>
Interpret equation number \( i \) in the linear system as a finite
difference approximation of \( u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx} \) using the following scheme:

<p>
$$
\begin{equation}
[D_tD_t( u + \frac{1}{6}\Delta x^2 D_xD_x u ) = c^2 D_xD_x u]_{i}^{n}
\label{oblig2:fdm:fem:discrete}
\thinspace .
\end{equation}
$$


<p>
<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
Write out equation number \( i \) and substitute \( c_j \) by \( u_j \) to help
interpreting finite element equations as finite difference schemes.
Study the material on <a href="http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/pub/sphinx-fem/main_fem.html#comparison-of-finite-element-and-finite-difference-approximation">interpreting the mass matrix as a finite difference
operator</a>.
The similarity of finite differences and elements regarding the \( u_{xx} \) term
is evident from a <a href="http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/pub/sphinx-fem/main_fem.html#computing-with-finite-elements">detailed example</a> in the course
material on solving \( -u_{xx}=f \) by finite elements.

<p>
<!-- --- end hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>e)</b>
Perform an analysis of the scheme \eqref{oblig2:fdm:fem:discrete}
in the same way as is done for the corresponding finite difference
scheme in the <a href="http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/pub/sphinx-wave/main_wave.html#analysis-of-the-continuous-and-discrete-solutions">course notes</a>.
That is, investigate a Fourier component \( u^n_p = \exp{(i(kp\Delta x - \tilde
\omega n\Delta t))} \). Show that the stability criterion is
$$ C \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}},$$

and therefore that any hope for recovering the exact solution for \( C=1 \)
becomes impossible.

<p>
<b>f)</b>
Find the numerical dispersion relation
(\( \tilde\omega \) expressed by other parameters) and plot the
error in wave velocity \( \tilde c/c \) (\( \tilde c = \tilde \omega/k \), \( c=\omega/c \))
as a function of \( k\Delta x \) for various Courant numbers.
Compare with <a href="http://hplgit.github.com/INF5620/doc/pub/sphinx-wave/main_wave.html#wave-pde1-fig-disprel">the corresponding plot for the finite difference method</a> for \( u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx} \) (computed with the aid of the
program <a href="https://github.com/hplgit/INF5620/blob/gh-pages/src/wave/dispersion_relation_1D.py">dispersion_relation_1D.py</a>).

<p>
<b>g)</b>
Use the Trapezoidal rule to compute the \( M \) matrix. Show that the finite
element method with P1 elements now produces the same scheme at the
interior mesh points as the standard finite difference method for
\( u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx} \). Also show that the equations for \( i=1 \) and
\( i=N_x \) are identical in the two methods.

<p>
<b>h)</b>
Instead of using the Trapezoidal rule to produce a diagonal \( M \) matrix,
one can replace \( M \) by \( \mbox{diag}(Me) \), where \( e=(1,1,\ldots,1) \)
and \( \mbox{diag}(w) \) means a diagonal matrix with the vector \( w \)
on the diagonal. The interpretation of this approach is that we
sum each row in \( M \) and place the sum on the diagonal.
Show that this method produces the same results as Trapezoidal integration
(in a 1D problem). Also show that if you replace each row in the element
matrices associated with \( M \) by the row sum on the diagonal, the same
result arises.

<!-- Closing remarks for this Project -->

<h4>Remarks  <a name="___sec1"></a></h4>

<p>
Say we want to solve the 3D wave equation \( u_{tt}=c^2\nabla^2u \) with
finite elements and get the same stability as in the finite difference
method. We can then compute \( M \) and \( K \) in the usual way and thereafter
just replace \( M \) by \( \mbox{diag}(Me) \). When the mass matrix is lumped
this way and becomes diagonal, we get the same representation of
of the terms
\( u^{n-1} \), \( u^n \), and \( u^{n+1} \) as in the finite difference method.
The \( K \) matrix also resembles finite differences for P1 elements.
With Q1 elements the \( K \) matrix has more nonzero entries per row, but
this does not change the numerical properties of the scheme significantly.
The key issue is to use a lumped mass matrix.
