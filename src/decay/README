Overview of files:

decay1.py: simple program for solving u'=-a*u, u(0)=I by the theta-rule
decay2.py: as decay1.py, but with a verification function
decay3.py: like decay2.py, but with a better verification function
decay4.py: as decay3.py, but with Matplotlib plotting
decay5.py: as decay4.py, but with SciTools plotting
decay6.py: as decay4.py, but with input data on the command line
decay7.py: as decay6.py, but using ArgumentParser for reading the command line
decay8.py: as decay7.py, with computation of convergence rates
decay_theta.py: module summarizing decay[1-7].py
decay_theta_v2.py: as decay_theta_v2.py, but using np and plt module prefixes
decay9.py: decay[3,4,7].py, but the algorithm avoids using arrays
clean.sh: remove all files that can be regenerated
